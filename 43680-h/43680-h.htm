<h2><a name="FOREWORD" id="FOREWORD">FOREWORD</a></h2>

<p>In the midst of the turmoil and bloodshed in Russia people perish
and the real outlines of historical events are obliterated. It is for
this reason that I have decided to publish these memoirs, in spite
of the difficulties of work in my present condition of a refugee,
unable to refer to any archives or documents and deprived of the
possibility of discussing events with those who have taken part
in them.</p>

<p>The first part of my book deals chiefly with the Russian Army,
with which my life has been closely linked up. Political, social
and economic questions are discussed only in so far as I have
found it necessary to describe their influence upon the course of
events.</p>

<p>In 1917 the Army played a decisive part in the fate of Russia.
Its participation in the progress of the Revolution, its life, degradation
and collapse should serve as a great warning and a lesson to
the new builders of Russian life. This applies not only to the
struggle against the present tyrants. When Bolshevism is
defeated, the Russian people will have to undertake the tremendous
task of reviving its moral and material forces, as well
as that of preserving its sovereign existence. Never in history
has this task been as arduous as it is now, because there are many
outside Russia&rsquo;s borders waiting eagerly for her end. They are
waiting in vain. The Russian people will rise in strength and
wisdom from the deathbed of blood, horror and poverty, moral
and physical.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I.</a><br />
<span class="smcap">The Foundations of the Old Power: Faith, the Czar and the
Mother Country.</span></h2>

<p>The inevitable historical process which culminated in the
Revolution of March, 1917, has resulted in the collapse of
the Russian State. Philosophers, historians and sociologists, in
studying the course of Russian life, may have foreseen the impending
catastrophe. But nobody could foresee that the people, rising
like a tidal wave, would so rapidly and so easily sweep away all
the foundations of their existence: the Supreme Power and the
Governing classes which disappeared without a struggle; the
intelligencia, gifted but weak, isolated and lacking will-power,
which at first, in the midst of a deadly struggle, had only words
as a weapon, later submissively bent their necks under the knife
of the victors; and last, but not least, an army of ten million,
powerful and imbued with historic traditions. That army was
destroyed in three or four months.</p>

<p>This last event&mdash;the collapse of the army&mdash;was not, however,
quite unexpected, as the epilogue of the Manchurian war and the
subsequent events in Moscow, Kronstadt and Sevastopol were a
terrible warning. At the end of November, 1905, I lived for a
fortnight in Harbin, and travelled on the Siberian Railway for
thirty-one days in December, 1907, through a series of
&ldquo;republics&rdquo; from Harbin to Petrograd. I thus gained a clear
indication of what might be expected from a licentious mob of
soldiers utterly devoid of restraining principles. All the meetings,
resolutions, soviets&mdash;in a word, all the manifestations of a
mutiny of the military&mdash;were repeated in 1917 with photographic
accuracy, but with greater impetus and on a much larger scale.</p>

<p>It should be noted that the possibility of such a rapid
psychological transformation was not characteristic of the Russian
Army alone. There can be no doubt that war-weariness after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
three years of bloodshed played an important part in these events,
as the armies of the whole world were affected by it and were
rendered more accessible to the disintegrating influences of
extreme Socialist doctrines. In the autumn of 1918 the German
Army Corps that occupied the region of the Don and Little Russia
were demoralised in one week, and they repeated to a certain
extent the process which we had already lived through of meetings,
soviets, committees, of doing away with Commanding
Officers, and in some units of the sale of military stores, horses
and arms. It was not till then that the Germans understood the
tragedy of the Russian officers. More than once our volunteers
saw the German officers, formerly so haughty and so frigid,
weeping bitterly over their degradation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have done the same to us; you have done it with your
own hands,&rdquo; we said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not we; it was our Government,&rdquo; was their reply.</p>

<p>In the winter of 1918, as Commander-in-Chief of the
Volunteer Army, I received an offer from a group of German
officers to join our army as volunteers in the ranks.</p>

<p>The collapse of the army cannot be explained away as the
psychological result of defeats and disasters. Even the victors
experienced disturbances in the army. There was a certain
amount of disaffection among the French troops occupying, in
the beginning of 1918, the region of Odessa and Roumania, in
the French fleet cruising in the Black Sea, among the British
troops in the region of Constantinople and Transcaucasia. The
troops did not always obey the orders of their Commanding
Officers. Rapid demobilisation and the arrival of fresh, partly
volunteer elements, altered the situation.</p>

<p>What was the condition of the Russian Army at the outbreak
of the Revolution? From time immemorial the entire ideology
of our soldiers was contained in the well-known formula: &ldquo;For
God, for the Czar and for the Mother Country.&rdquo; Generation after
generation was born and bred on that formula. These ideas,
however, did not penetrate deeply enough into the masses of the
people and of the army. For many centuries the Russian people
had been deeply religious, but their faith was somewhat shaken
in the beginning of the Twentieth Century. The Russian people,
as the Russian saying goes, was &ldquo;the bearer of Christ&rdquo;&mdash;a people
inwardly disposed towards Universal Brotherhood, great in its
simplicity, truthfulness, humility and forgiveness. That people,
Christian in the fullest sense of the word, was gradually changing
as it came under the influence of material interests, and learnt or
was taught to see in the gratifying of those interests the sole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
purpose of life. The link between the people and its spiritual
leaders was gradually weakening as these leaders were detached
from the people, entered into the service of the Governing
powers, and shared the latter&rsquo;s deficiencies. The development of
this moral transformation of the Russian people is too deep and
too complex to fall within the scope of these memoirs. It is
undeniable that the youngsters who joined the ranks treated
questions of the Faith and of the Church with indifference. In
barracks they lost the habits of their homes, and were forcibly
removed from a more wholesome and settled atmosphere, with all
its creeds and superstitions. They received no spiritual or moral
education, which in barracks was considered a matter of minor
importance, completely overshadowed by practical and material
cares and requirements. A proper spirit could not be created in
barracks, where Christian morals, religious discourses, and even
the rites of the Church bore an official and sometimes even compulsory
character. Commanding Officers know how difficult it
was to find a solution of the vexed question of attendance at
Church services.</p>

<p>War introduced two new elements into the spiritual life of the
army. On the one hand, there was a certain moral coarseness
and cruelty; on the other, it seemed as if faith had been deepened
by constant danger. I do not wish to accuse the orthodox military
clergy as a body. Many of its representatives proved their high
valour, courage and self-sacrifice. It must, however, be admitted
that the clergy failed to produce a religious revival among the
troops. It is not their fault, because the world-war into which
Russia was drawn was due to intricate political and economic
causes, and there was no room for religious fervour. The clergy,
however, likewise failed to establish closer connection with the
troops. After the outbreak of the Revolution the officers continued
for a long time to struggle to keep their waning power
and authority, but the voice of the priests was silenced almost
at once, and they ceased to play any part whatsoever in the life
of the troops. I recall an episode typical of the mental attitude
of military circles in those days. One of the regiments of the
Fourth Rifle Division had built a camp Church quite close to
its lines, and had built it with great care and very artistically. The
Revolution came. A demagogue captain decided that his
company had inadequate quarters and that a Church was a superstition.
On his own authority he converted the Church into
quarters for his company, and dug a hole where the altar stood
for purposes which it is better not to mention. I am not surprised
that such a scoundrel was found in the regiment or that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
the Higher Command was terrorised and silent. But why did two
or three thousand orthodox Russians, bred in the mystic rites
of their faith, remain indifferent to such a sacrilege? Be that as
it may, there can hardly be any doubt that religion ceased to be
one of the moral impulses which upheld the spirit of the Russian
Army and prompted it to deeds of valour or protected it later
from the development of bestial instincts. The orthodox clergy,
generally speaking, was thrown overboard during the storm.
Some of the high dignitaries of the Church&mdash;the Metropolitans&mdash;Pitirim
and Makarius&mdash;the Archbishop Varnava and others, unfortunately
were closely connected with the Governing bureaucracy of
the Rasputin period of Petrograd history. The lower grades of
the clergy, on the other hand, were in close touch with the Russian
intellectuals.</p>

<p>I cannot take it upon myself to judge of the extent to which
the Russian Church remained an active force after it came under
the yoke of the Bolsheviks. An impenetrable veil hangs over the
life of the Russian Church in Soviet Russia, but there can be
no doubt that spiritual renaissance is progressing and spreading,
that the martyrdom of hundreds, nay, thousands, of priests is
waking the dormant conscience of the people and is becoming a
legend in their minds.</p>

<p>THE CZAR.</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to prove that the enormous majority of
the Commanding Officers were thoroughly loyal to the Monarchist
idea and to the Czar himself. The subsequent behaviour of
the higher Commanding Officers who had been Monarchists
was due partly to motives of self-seeking, partly to pusillanimity
and to the desire to conceal their real feelings in order to remain
in power and to carry out their own plans. Cases in which a
change of front was the result of the collapse of ideals, of a
new outlook, or was prompted by motives of practical statesmanship,
were rare. For example, it would have been childish to have
believed General Brussilov when he asserted that from the days of
his youth he had been &ldquo;a Socialist and a Republican.&rdquo; He was
bred in the traditions of the Old Guards, was closely connected
with circles of the Court, and permeated with their outlook. His
habits, tastes, sympathies and surroundings were those of a
<i>barin</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> No man can be a lifelong liar to himself and to others.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
The majority of the officers of the Regular Russian Army had
Monarchist principles and were undoubtedly loyal. After the
Japanese war, as a result of the first Revolution, the Officers&rsquo; Corps
was, nevertheless, placed, for reasons which are not sufficiently
clear, under the special supervision of the Police Department, and
regimental Commanding Officers received from time to time
&ldquo;black lists.&rdquo; The tragedy of it was that it was almost useless to
argue against the verdict of &ldquo;unreliability,&rdquo; while, at the same
time, it was forbidden to conduct one&rsquo;s own investigation, even
in secret. This system of spying introduced an unwholesome
spirit into the army. Not content with this system, the War
Minister, General Sukhomlinov, introduced his own branch of
counter-spies, which was headed unofficially by Colonel Miassoyedov,
who was afterwards shot as a German spy. At every military
District Headquarters an organ was instituted, headed by an
officer of the Gendarmerie dressed up in G.H.Q. uniform.
Officially, he was supposed to deal with foreign espionage, but
General Dukhonin (who was killed by the Bolsheviks), when Chief
of the Intelligence Bureau of the Kiev G.H.Q. before the War,
bitterly complained to me of the painful atmosphere created by
this new organ, which was officially subordinate to the
Quartermaster-General, but in reality looked on him with
suspicion, and was spying not only upon the Staff, but upon its
own chiefs.</p>

<p>Life itself seemed to induce the officers to utter some kind of
protest against the existing order. Of all the classes that served
the State, there had been for a long time no element so downtrodden
and forlorn or so ill-provided for as the officers of the
Regular Russian Army. They lived in abject poverty. Their
rights and their self-esteem were constantly ignored by the Senior
Officers. The utmost the rank and file could hope for as the
crowning of their career was the rank of Colonel and an old age
spent in sickness and semi-starvation. From the middle of the
nineteenth century the Officers&rsquo; Corps had completely lost its
character as a class and a caste. Since universal compulsory service
was introduced and the nobility ceased to be prosperous the
gates of military schools were opened wide to people of low
extraction and to young men belonging to the lower strata of the
people, but with a diploma from the civil schools. They formed a
majority in the Army. Mobilisations, on the other hand, reinforced
the Officers&rsquo; Corps by the infusion of a great many men of the
liberal professions, who introduced new ideas and a new outlook.
Finally, the tremendous losses suffered by the Regular Officers&rsquo;
Corps compelled the High Command to relax to a certain extent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
the regulations concerning military training and education, and to
introduce on a broad scale promotions from the ranks for deeds
of valour, and to give rankers a short training in elementary
schools to fit them to be temporary officers.</p>

<p>These circumstances, characteristic of all armies formed from
the masses, undoubtedly reduced the fighting capacity of the
Officers&rsquo; Corps, and brought about a certain change in its political
outlook, bringing it nearer to that of the average Russian
intellectual and to democracy. This the leaders of the
Revolutionary democracy did not, or, to be more accurate, would
not, understand in the first days of the Revolution. In the course
of my narrative I will differentiate between the &ldquo;Revolutionary
Democracy&rdquo;&mdash;an agglomeration of socialist parties&mdash;and the true
Russian Democracy, to which the middle-class intelligencia and the
Civil Service elements undoubtedly belong.</p>

<p>The spirit of the Regular Officers was, however, gradually
changing. The Japanese War, which disclosed the grave shortcomings
of the country and of the Army, the Duma and the Press,
which had gained a certain liberty after 1905, played an important
part in the political education of the officers. The mystic adoration
of the Monarch began gradually to vanish. Among the
junior generals and other officers there appeared men in
increasing numbers capable of differentiating between the idea of
the Monarchy and personalities, between the welfare of the
country and the form of government. In officer circles opportunities
occurred for criticism, analysis, and sometimes for severe
condemnation.</p>

<p>It is to be wondered that in these circumstances our officers
remained steadfast and stoutly resisted the extremist, destructive
currents of political thought. The percentage of men who
reached the depths and were unmasked by the authorities was
insignificant. With regard to the throne, generally speaking,
there was a tendency among the officers to separate the person of
the Emperor from the miasma with which he was surrounded,
from the political errors and misdeeds of the Government, which
was leading the country steadily to ruin and the Army to defeat.
They wanted to forgive the Emperor, and tried to make excuses
for him.</p>

<p>In spite of the accepted view, the monarchical idea had no
deep, mystic roots among the rank and file, and, of course, the
semi-cultured masses entirely failed to realise the meaning of other
forms of Government preached by Socialists of all shades of
opinion. Owing to a certain innate Conservatism, to habits
dating from time immemorial, and to the teaching of the Church,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
the existing rÃ©gime was considered as something quite natural and
inevitable. In the mind and in the heart of the soldier the idea
of a monarch was, if I may so express it, &ldquo;in a potential state,&rdquo;
rising sometimes to a point of high exaltation when the monarch
was personally approached (at reviews, parades and casual meetings),
and sometimes falling to indifference. At any rate, the
Army was in a disposition sufficiently favourable to the idea of a
monarchy and to the dynasty, and that disposition could have
easily been maintained. But a sticky cobweb of licentiousness and
crime was being woven at Petrograd and Czarskoe Selo. The
truth, intermingled with falsehood, penetrated into the remotest
corners of the country and into the Army, and evoked painful
regrets and sometimes malicious rejoicings. The members of the
House of Romanov did not preserve the &ldquo;idea&rdquo; which the
orthodox monarchists wished to surround with a halo of greatness,
nobility and reverence. I recall the impression of a sitting
of the Duma which I happened to attend. For the first time,
Gutchkov uttered a word of warning from the Tribune of the
Duma about Rasputin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All is not well with our land.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The House, which had been rather noisy, was silent, and every
word, spoken in a low voice, was distinctly audible in remote
corners. A mysterious cloud, pregnant with catastrophe, seemed
to hang over the normal course of Russian history. I will not
dwell on the corrupt influences prevailing in Ministerial dwellings
and Imperial palaces to which the filthy and cynical impostor found
access, who swayed ministers and rulers.</p>

<p>The Grand Duke Nicholas is supposed to have threatened to
hang Rasputin should he venture to appear at G.H.Q. General
Alexeiev also disapproved strongly of the man. That the influence
of Rasputin did not spread to the old Army is due entirely to the
attitude of the above-named generals. All sorts of stories about
Rasputin&rsquo;s influence was circulated at the front, and the Censor
collected an enormous amount of material on the subject, even
from soldiers&rsquo; letters from the front; but the gravest impression
was produced by the word &ldquo;TREASON&rdquo; with reference to the
Empress. In the Army, openly and everywhere, conversations
were heard about the Empress&rsquo; persistent demands for a separate
peace and of her treachery towards Lord Kitchener, of whose
journey she was supposed to have informed the Germans. As I
recall the past, and the impression produced in the Army by the
<i>rumour</i> of the Empress&rsquo; treason, I consider that this circumstance
had a very great influence upon the attitude of the Army towards
the dynasty and the revolution. In the spring of 1917 I questioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
General Alexeiev on this painful subject. His answer, reluctantly
given, was vague. He said: &ldquo;When the Empress&rsquo; papers were
examined she was found to be in possession of a map indicating
in detail the disposition of the troops along the entire front. Only
two copies were prepared of this map, one for the Emperor and
one for myself. I was very painfully impressed. God knows who
may have made use of this map.&rdquo;</p>

<p>History will undoubtedly throw light on the fateful influence
exercised by the Empress Alexandra upon the Russian Government
in the period preceding the Revolution. As regards the
question of treason, this disastrous rumour has not been confirmed
by a single fact, and was afterwards contradicted by the investigations
of a Commission specially appointed by the Provisional
Government, on which representatives of the Soviet of workmen
and soldiers served.</p>

<p>We now come to the third foundation&mdash;the <i>Mother Country</i>.
Deafened as we were, alas! by the thunder and rattle of conventional
patriotic phrases, endlessly repeated along the whole
length and breadth of Russia, we failed to detect the fundamental,
innate defect of the Russian people&mdash;its lack of patriotism. It is
no longer necessary to force an open door by proving this statement.
The Brest-Litovsk Treaty provoked no outburst of popular
wrath. Russian society was indifferent to the separation of the
Border States, even those that were Russian in spirit and in blood.
What is more, Russian society approved of this dismemberment.
We know of the agreement between Poland and Petlura, between
Poland and the Soviet. We know that Russian territorial and
material riches were sold for a song to international, political
usurers. Need we adduce further proofs?</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that the collapse of Russian Statehood
as manifested in &ldquo;self-determination&rdquo; was in several instances
caused by the desire to find a temporary safeguard against the
Bedlam of the Soviet Republic. Life, however, unfortunately
does not stop at the practical application of this peculiar &ldquo;sanitary
cordon,&rdquo; but strikes at the very idea of Statehood. This occurred
even in such stable districts as the Cossack provinces, not, however,
among the masses, but among the leaders themselves. Thus
at Ekaterinodar in 1920, at the &ldquo;High Krug&rdquo; (Assembly) of the
three Cossack armies, the mention of Russia was omitted after
a heated discussion from the proposed formula of the oath....</p>

<p>Is Crucified Russia unworthy of our love?</p>

<p>What, then, was the effect of the Mother Country idea upon
the conscience of the old Army? The upper strata of the Russian
intellectuals were well aware of the reasons for the world con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>flagration,
of the conflict of the Powers for political and economic
supremacy, for free routes, for markets and colonies&mdash;a conflict
in which Russia&rsquo;s part was merely one of self-defence. On the
other hand, the average number of the Russian <i>intelligencia</i>, as well
as officers, were often satisfied merely with the immediate and
more obvious and easily comprehensible causes. Nobody wanted
the war, except, perhaps, the impressionable young officers yearning
for exploits. It was believed that the powers-that-be would
take every precaution in order to avoid a rupture. Gradually,
however, the fatal inevitability of war was understood. There was
no question on our part of aggressiveness or self-interest. To
sympathise sincerely with the weak and the oppressed was in keeping
with the traditional attitude of Russia. Also, we did not draw
the sword&mdash;the sword was drawn against us. That is why, when
the war began, the voices were silenced of those who feared that,
owing to the low level of her culture and economic development,
Russia would be unable to win in the contest with a strong and
cultured enemy. War was accepted in a patriotic spirit, which was
at times akin to enthusiasm. Like the majority of the
intellectuals, the officers did not take much interest in the
question of war aims. The war began; defeat would have led to
immeasurable disaster to our country in every sphere of its life,
to territorial losses, political decadence and economic slavery.
Victory was, therefore, a necessity. All other questions were
relegated to the background. There was plenty of time for their
discussion, for new decisions and for changes. This simplified
attitude towards the war, coupled with a profound understanding
and with a national self-consciousness, was not understood by the
left wing of the Russian politicians, who were driven to Zimmerwald
and Kienthal. No wonder, therefore, that when the
anonymous and the Russian leaders of the Revolutionary
democracy were confronted in February, 1917, before the Army
was deliberately destroyed, with the dilemma: &ldquo;Are we to save
the country or the Revolution?&rdquo; they chose the latter.</p>

<p>Still less did the illiterate masses of the people understand the
idea of national self-preservation. The people went to war submissively,
but without enthusiasm and without any clear
perception of the necessity for a great sacrifice. Their
psychology did not rise to the understanding of abstract national
principles. &ldquo;The people-in-arms,&rdquo; for that was what the Army
really was, were elated by victory and downhearted when defeated.
They did not fully understand the necessity for crossing the Carpathians,
and had, perhaps, a clearer idea of the meaning of the
struggle on the Styr and the Pripet. And yet it found solace in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
the thought: &ldquo;We are from Tambov; the Germans will not
reach us.&rdquo; It is necessary to repeat this stale saying, because it
expresses the deep-rooted psychology of the average Russian.
As a result of this predominance of material interests in the outlook
of &ldquo;the people-in-arms,&rdquo; they grasped more easily the
simple arguments based on realities in favour of a stubborn fight
and of victory, as well as the impossibility of admitting defeat.
These arguments were: A foreign German domination, the ruin
of the country and of the home, the weight of the taxes which
would inevitably be levied after defeat, the fall in the price of
grain, which would have to go through foreign channels, etc. In
addition, there was some feeling of confidence that the Government
was doing the right thing, the more so as the nearest representatives
of that power, the officers, were going forward with the
troops and were dying in the same spirit of readiness and submission
as the men, either because they had been ordered to do
so, or else because they thought it their duty. The rank and
file, therefore, bravely faced death. Afterwards when confidence
was shaken, the masses of the Army were completely perplexed.
The formulas, &ldquo;without annexations and indemnities,&rdquo; &ldquo;the
self-determination of peoples,&rdquo; etc., proved more abstract and less
intelligible than the old repudiated and rusty idea of the Mother
Country, which still persisted underneath them. In order to keep
the men at the front, the well-known arguments of a materialistic
nature, such as the threat of German domination, the ruin of
the home, the weight of taxes, were expounded from platforms
decorated with red flags. They were taught by Socialists, who
favoured a war of defence.</p>

<p>Thus the three principles which formed the foundations of the
Army were undermined. In describing the anomalies and spiritual
shortcomings of the Russian Army, far be it from me to place
it below the level of armies of other countries. These shortcomings
are inherent in all armies formed from the masses, which
are almost akin to a militia, but this did not prevent these armies
or our own from gaining victories and continuing the war. It is
necessary, however, to draw a complete picture of the spirit of
the Army in order to understand its subsequent destiny.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</a><br />
<span class="smcap">The Army.</span></h2>

<p>The Russo-Japanese war had a very great influence upon the
development of the Russian army. The bitterness of defeat
and the clear consciousness that the policy governing military
affairs was disastrously out of date gave a great impulse to the
junior military elements and forced the slack and inert elements
gradually to alter their ways or else to retire. In spite of the passive
resistance of several men at the head of the War Ministry and
the General Staff, who were either incompetent or else treated
the interests of the army with levity and indifference, work was
done at full speed. In ten years the Russian army, without of
course attaining the ideal, made tremendous progress. It may be
confidently asserted that, had it not been for the hard lessons of
the Manchurian campaign, Russia would have been crushed in the
first months of the Great War.</p>

<p>Yet the cleansing of the commanding personnel went too
slowly. Our softness (&ldquo;Poor devil! we must give him a job&rdquo;),
wire-pulling, intrigues, and too slavish an observance of the rules
of seniority resulted in the ranks of senior commanding officers
being crowded with worthless men. The High Commission for
granting testimonials, which sat twice a year in Petrograd, hardly
knew any of those to whom these testimonials were given. Therein
lies the reason for the mistakes made at the outbreak of war in
many appointments to High Commands. Four Commanders-in-Chief
(one of them suffered from mental paralysis&mdash;it is true that
his appointment was only temporary), several Army Commanders,
many Army Corps and Divisional Commanders had to be
dismissed. In the very first days of the concentration of the
Eighth Army, in July, 1914, General Brussilov dismissed three
Divisional and one Army Corps Commanders. Yet nonentities retained
their commands, and they ruined the troops and the operations.
Under the same General Brussilov, General D., relieved
several times of his command, went from a cavalry division to
three infantry divisions in turn, and found final repose in German
captivity. Most unfortunately, the whole army was aware of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
incompetence of these Commanding Officers, and wondered at
their appointments. Owing to these deficiencies, the strategy of
the entire campaign lacked inspiration and boldness. Such, for
example, were the operations of the North-Western front in East
Prussia, prompted solely by the desire of G.H.Q. to save the
French Army from a desperate position. Such, in particular, was
Rennenkampf&rsquo;s shameful man&oelig;uvre, as well as the stubborn forcing
of the Carpathians, which dismembered the troops of the
South-Western front in 1915, and finally our advance in the spring
of 1916.</p>

<p>The last episode was so typical of the methods of our High
Command and its consequences were so grave that it is worth our
while to recall it.</p>

<p>When the armies of the South-Western front took the offensive
in May, the attack was eminently successful and several Austrian
divisions were heavily defeated. When my division, after the capture
of Lutsk, was moving by forced marches to Vladimir
Volynsk, I considered&mdash;and we all considered&mdash;that our man&oelig;uvre
represented the entire scheme of the advance, that our
front was dealing the main blow. We learnt afterwards that the
task of dealing the main blow had been entrusted to the Western
front, and that Brussilov&rsquo;s armies were only making a demonstration.
There, towards Vilna, large forces had been gathered,
equipped with artillery and technical means such as we had never
had before. For several months the troops had been preparing
<i>places d&rsquo;armes</i> for the advance. At last all was ready, and the
success of the Southern armies that diverted the enemy&rsquo;s attention
and his reserves also promised success to the Western front.</p>

<p>Almost on the eve of the contemplated offensive the historical
conversation took place on the telephone between General Evert,
C.-in-C. of the Western front, and General Alexeiev, Chief of
Staff of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief. The gist of the conversation
was the following:</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Circumstances require an immediate decision. Are you
ready for the advance and are you certain to be successful?</p>

<p><i>E.</i> I have no certainty of success. The enemy&rsquo;s positions are
very strong. Our troops will have to attack the positions against
which their previous attacks have failed.</p>

<p><i>A.</i> If that is the case, you must give immediate orders for the
transfer of troops to the South-Western front. I will report to
the Emperor.</p>

<p>So the operation, so long awaited and so methodically prepared,
collapsed. The Western Army Corps, sent to reinforce us, came
too late. Our advance was checked. The senseless slaughter on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
the swampy banks of the Stokhod then began. Incidentally, the
Guards lost the flower of their men in those battles. Meanwhile,
the German Eastern front was going through a period of intense
anxiety. &ldquo;It was a critical time,&rdquo; says Ludendorff in his <i>Mes
Souvenirs de Guerre</i>. &ldquo;We had spent ourselves, and we knew
full well that no one would come to our assistance if the Russians
chose to attack us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>An episode may be mentioned in this connection, which occurred
to General Brussilov. The story is not widely known, and
may serve as an interesting sidelight on the character of the
General&mdash;one of the leaders of the campaign. After the brilliant
operations of the Eighth Army, which ended in the crossing of the
Carpathians and the invasion of Hungary, the C.-in-C., General
Brussilov, suffered a curious psychological breakdown. Under
the impression that a partial reverse had been sustained by one of
the Army Corps, he issued an order for a general retreat, and the
Army began rapidly to roll back. He was haunted by imaginary
dangers of the enemy breaking through, surrounding our troops,
of attacks of enemy cavalry which were supposed to threaten the
G.H.Q. Twice General Brussilov moved his H.Q. with a swiftness
akin to a panicky flight. The C.-in-C. was thus detached
from his armies and out of touch with them.</p>

<p>We were retreating day after day in long, weary marches, and
utterly bewildered. The Austrians did not outnumber us, and
their moral was no higher than ours. They did not press us.
Every day, my riflemen and Kornilov&rsquo;s troops in our vicinity
delivered short counter-attacks, took many prisoners, and
captured machine-guns.</p>

<p>The Quartermaster-General&rsquo;s branch of the Army was even
more puzzled. Every day it reported that the news of the retreat
was unfounded; but Brussilov at first disregarded these reports,
and later became greatly incensed. The General Staff then
had recourse to another stratagem: they approached Brussilov&rsquo;s
old friend, the veteran General Panchulidzev, Chief of the Army
Sanitation Branch, and persuaded him that, if this retreat continued,
the Army might suspect treason and things might take an
ugly turn. Panchulidzev visited Brussilov. An intensely painful
scene took place. As a result, Brussilov was found weeping bitterly
and Panchulidzev fainted. On the same day, an order was
issued for an advance, and the troops went forward rapidly and
easily, driving the Austrians before them. The strategical position
was restored as well as the reputation of the Army
Commander.</p>

<p>It must be admitted that not only the troops but the Comman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>ders
were but scantily informed of the happenings of the front,
and had hazy ideas on the general strategical scheme. The troops
criticised them only when it was obvious that they had to pay the
price of blood for these schemes. So it was in the Carpathians,
at Stokhod, during the second attack on Przemyshl in the spring
of 1917, etc. The moral of the troops was affected chiefly by the
great Galician retreat, the unhappy progress of the war on the
Northern and Western fronts&mdash;where no victories were won&mdash;and
by the tedious lingering for over a year in positions of which
everyone was sick to death.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I have already mentioned the cadres of commissioned officers.
The great and small shortcomings of these cadres increased as the
cadres became separated. No one expected the campaign to be
protracted, and the Army organisation was not careful to preserve
the cadres of officers and non-commissioned officers. They were
drafted wholesale into the ranks at the outbreak of war. I remember
so well a conversation that took place during the period
of mobilisation, which was then contemplated against Austria
alone. It occurred in the flat of General V. M. Dragomirov, one
of the prominent leaders of the Army. A telegram was brought
in announcing that Germany had declared war. There was a dead
silence. Everyone was deep in thought. Somebody asked
Dragomirov:</p>

<p>&ldquo;How long do you think the war will last?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Four months.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Companies went to the front sometimes with five to six officers.
Regular officers, and later the majority of other officers, invariably
and in all circumstances gave the example of prowess, pluck and
self-sacrifice. It is only natural that most of them were killed.
Another reliable element&mdash;the N.C.O.&rsquo;s of the Reserve&mdash;was also
recklessly squandered. In the beginning of the war they formed
sometimes 50 per cent. of the rank and file. Relations between
officers and men in the old army were not always based upon
healthy principles. It cannot be denied that there was a certain
aloofness caused by the insufficient attention paid by the officers
to the spiritual requirements of the soldier&rsquo;s life. These relations,
however, gradually improved as the barriers of caste and class
were broken down. The war drew officers and men ever closer
together, and in some regiments, mostly of the line, there was a
true brotherhood in arms. One reservation must here be made.
The outward intercourse bore the stamp of the general lack of cul<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>ture
from which not only the masses but also the Russian intellectuals
suffered. Heartfelt solicitude, touching care of the men&rsquo;s
needs, simplicity and friendliness&mdash;all these qualities of the Russian
officer, who lay for months on end in the wet, dirty trenches
beside their men, ate out of the same pot, died quietly and without
a murmur, was buried in the same &ldquo;fraternal grave&rdquo;&mdash;were
marred by an occasional roughness, swearing, and sometimes by
arbitrariness and blows.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that the same conditions existed within
the ranks, and the only difference was that the sergeant and the
corporal were rougher and more cruel than the officers. These
deplorable circumstances coupled with the boredom and stupidity
of barrack life, and the petty restrictions imposed upon the men by
the military regulations, gave ample scope for underground seditious
propaganda in which the soldier was described as the &ldquo;victim
of the arbitrariness of the men with golden epaulettes.&rdquo; The
sound feeling and naturally healthy outlook of the men was not
mentioned while the discomforts of military life were insisted
on in order to foster a spirit of discontent.</p>

<p>This state of affairs was all the more serious because during
the war the process of consolidating the different units became
more and more difficult. These units, and especially the infantry
regiments, suffering terrible losses and changing their personnel
ten or twelve times, became to some extent recruiting stations
through which men flowed in an uninterrupted stream. They remained
there but a short time, and failed to become imbued with
the military traditions of their unit. The artillery and some other
special branches remained comparatively solid, and this was due
in some measure to the fact that their losses were, as compared
with the losses suffered by the infantry, only in the proportion of
one to ten or one to twenty.</p>

<p>On the whole the atmosphere in the Army and in the Navy was
not, therefore, particularly wholesome. In varying degrees, the
two elements of the Army&mdash;the rank and file and the commanding
cadres&mdash;were divided. For this the Russian officers, as well as the
intellectuals, were undoubtedly responsible. Their misdeeds
resulted in the idea gaining ground that the <i>barin</i> (master) and
the officer were opposed to the <i>moujik</i> and the soldier. A
favourable atmosphere was thus created for the work of destructive
forces.</p>

<p>Anarchist elements were by no means predominant in the
Army. The foundations, though somewhat unstable, had to be
completely shattered; the new power had to commit a long series
of mistakes and crimes to convert the state of smouldering dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>content
into active rebellion, the bloody spectre of which will for
some time to come hang over our hapless Russian land.</p>

<p>Destructive outside influences were not counteracted in the
Army by a reasonable process of education. This was due partly
to the political unpreparedness of the officers, partly to the instinctive
fear felt by the old rÃ©gime of introducing &ldquo;politics&rdquo; into
barracks, even with a view to criticising subversive doctrines.
This fear was felt not only in respect of social and internal
problems but even in respect of foreign policy. Thus, for example,
an Imperial order was issued shortly before the war, strictly
prohibiting any discussion amongst the soldiers on the subject of
the political issues of the moment (the Balkan question, the Austro-Serbian
conflict, etc.). On the eve of the inevitable national war,
the authorities persistently refrained from awakening wholesome
patriotism by explaining the causes and aims of the war, and
instructing the rank and file on the Slav question and our long-drawn
struggle against Germanism. I must confess that, like
many others, I did not carry out that order, and that I endeavoured
properly to influence the moral of the Archangel regiment which
I then commanded. I published an impassioned article against the
order in the Military Press, under the title <i>Do not quench the
spirit</i>. I feel certain that the statue of Strassbourg in the
Place de la Concorde in Paris, draped in a black veil, played an important
part in fostering the heroic spirit of the French Army.</p>

<p>Propaganda penetrated into the old Russian Armies from all
sides. There can be no doubt that the fitful attempts of the ever-changing
governments of Goremykin, Sturmer, Trepov, etc., to
arrest the normal course of life in Russia, provided ample material
for propaganda and roused the anger of the people, which was reflected
in the Army. Socialist and defeatist writers took advantage
of this state of affairs. Lenin first contrived to introduce his
doctrines into Russia through the Social Democratic party of the
Duma. The Germans worked with even greater intensity.</p>

<p>It should, however, be noted that all this propaganda from
outside and from within affected chiefly the units of the rear, the
garrisons and reserve battalions of the main centres, and especially
of Petrograd, and that, before the Revolution, its influence
at the front was comparatively insignificant. Reinforcements
reached the front in a state of perplexity, but under the influence
of a saner atmosphere, and of healthier, albeit more arduous,
conditions of warfare, they rapidly improved. The effect of
destructive propaganda was, however, noticeable in certain units
where the ground was favourable, and two or three cases of
insubordination of entire units occurred before the Revolution,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
and were severely repressed. Finally, the bulk of the Army&mdash;the
peasantry&mdash;was confronted with one practical question which
<i>prompted them instinctively to delay the social revolution</i>: &ldquo;THE
LAND WOULD BE DIVIDED IN OUR ABSENCE. WHEN
WE RETURN WE SHALL DIVIDE IT.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The inadequate organisation of the rear, the orgy of theft,
high prices, profiteering and luxury, for which the front paid in
blood, naturally afforded material for propaganda. The Army,
however, suffered most heavily from the lack of technical means,
especially of ammunition.</p>

<p>It was only in 1917 that General Sukhomlinov&rsquo;s trial disclosed
to the Russian Army and to public opinion the main causes of the
military catastrophe of 1915. Plans for replenishing the Russian
Army stores had been completed, and credits for that purpose
assigned as early as in 1907. Curiously enough, these credits were
increased on the initiative of the Commission for National
Defence, not of the Ministry of War. As a rule, neither the
Duma nor the Ministry of Finance ever refused war credits or
reduced them. During Sukhomlinov&rsquo;s tenure of office the War
Ministry obtained a special credit of 450 million roubles, of which
less than 300 millions were spent. Before the war, the question
of providing the Army with munitions after the peace-time stores
were exhausted was never even raised. It is true that the intensity
of firing reached, from the very outbreak of war, unexpected and
unheard-of proportions, which upset all the theoretical calculations
of military specialists in Russia and abroad. Naturally,
heroic measures were necessary in order to deal with this tragic
situation.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the supplies of ammunition for the reinforcements
that came to the front&mdash;at first only 1/10th equipped, and later
without any rifles at all&mdash;were exhausted as early as in October,
1914. The Commander-in-Chief of the South-Western front telegraphed
to G.H.Q.: &ldquo;The machinery for providing ammunition
has completely broken down. In the absence of fresh supplies, we
shall have to cease fighting, or else send troops to the front in an
extremely precarious condition.&rdquo; At the same time (the end of
September) Marshal Joffre inquired &ldquo;whether the Imperial
Russian Army was adequately supplied with shells for the uninterrupted
conduct of war.&rdquo; The War Minister, General Sukhomlinov,
replied: &ldquo;The present condition of the Russian Army in
respect of ammunition gives no ground for serious apprehension.&rdquo;
Orders were not placed abroad, and Japanese and American rifles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
were refused &ldquo;in order to avoid the inconvenience due to different
calibres.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the man who was responsible for the military catastrophe
faced his judges in August, 1917, his personality produced a pitiful
impression. The trial raised a more serious, painful question:
&ldquo;How could this irresponsible man, with no real knowledge of
military matters, and perhaps even consciously a criminal, have
remained in power for six years?&rdquo; How &ldquo;shamelessly indifferent
to good and evil,&rdquo; according to Pushkin&rsquo;s saying, the
military bureaucracy must have been, that surrounded him and
tolerated the sins of omission and commission, which invariably
and systematically injured the interests of the State.</p>

<p>The final catastrophe came in 1915.</p>

<p>I shall never forget the spring of 1915, the great tragedy of the
Russian Army&mdash;-the Galician retreat. We had neither cartridges
nor shells. From day to day, we fought heavy battles and
did lengthy marches. We were desperately tired&mdash;physically and
morally. From hazy hopes we plunged into the depths of gloom.
I recall an action near Przemyshl in the middle of May. The
Fourth Rifle Division fought fiercely for eleven days. For eleven
days the German heavy guns were roaring, and they literally blew
up rows of trenches, with all their defenders. We scarcely replied
at all&mdash;we had nothing to reply with. Utterly exhausted regiments
were beating off one attack after another with bayonets, or firing
at a close range. Blood was flowing, the ranks were being
thinned, and graveyards growing. Two regiments were almost
entirely annihilated by firing.</p>

<p>I would that our French and British friends, whose technical
achievement is so wondrous, could note the following grotesque
fact, which belongs to Russian history:</p>

<p>Our only six-inch battery had been silent for three days. When
it received <span class="small">FIFTY SHELLS</span> the fact was immediately telephoned to
all regiments and companies, and all the riflemen heaved a sigh
of relief and joy.</p>

<p>What painful, insulting irony there was in Brussilov&rsquo;s circular,
in which the C.-in-C., incapable of providing us with ammunition,
and with a view to raising our spirits and our moral, advised us
not to lay too much stress upon the German superiority in heavy
guns, because there had been many cases of the Germans inflicting
but small losses in our ranks by spending an enormous amount of
shells....</p>

<p>On May 21st, General Yanushkevitch (Chief of the Staff of the
Supreme C.-in-C., the Grand Duke Nicholas Nicholaievitch) telegraphed
to the War Minister: &ldquo;The evacuation of Przemyshl is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
an accomplished fact. Brussilov alleges a shortage of ammunition,
that <i>bÃªte noire</i>, yours and mine ... a loud cry comes
from all the armies: &lsquo;Give us cartridges.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I am not inclined to idealise our Army. I have to speak many
sad truths about it. But when the Pharisees&mdash;the leaders of the
Russian Revolutionary Democracy&mdash;endeavour to explain away
the collapse of the Army for which they are mainly responsible, by
saying that the Army was already on the verge of collapse, they
are lying.</p>

<p>I do not deny the grave shortcomings of our system of appointments
to the High Command, the errors of our strategy, tactics
and organisation, the technical backwardness of our Army, the
defects of the Officers&rsquo; Corps, the ignorance of the rank and file,
and the vices of barrack life. I know the extent of desertions and
shirking, of which our intellectuals were hardly less guilty than
the ignorant masses. The Revolutionary Democracy did not,
however, devote special attention to <i>these</i> serious defects of the
Army. It could not remedy these evils, did not know how to cure
them, and, in fact, did not combat them at all. Speaking for
myself, I do not know that the Revolutionary Democracy has
cured or even dealt seriously and effectively with any one of these
evils. What of the famous &ldquo;Freedom from Bondage&rdquo; of the
soldier? Discarding all the exaggerations which this term implies,
it may be said that the mere fact of the Revolution brought about
a certain change in the relations between the officers and the men.
In normal circumstances, and without coarse and malicious outside
interference, this change might have become a source of great
moral strength, instead of a disaster. It was into this sore that
the Revolutionary Democracy poured poison. The very essence
of the military organisation: its eternal, unchangeable characteristics,
discipline, individual authority, and the non-political spirit
of the Army, were ruthlessly assailed by the Revolutionary
Democracy. These characteristics were lost. And yet it seemed
as if the downfall of the old rÃ©gime opened new and immense possibilities
for cleansing and uplifting the Russian people&rsquo;s Army and
its Command morally and technically. Like people, like Army.
After all, the old Russian Army, albeit suffering from the deficiencies
of the Russian people, had also the people&rsquo;s virtues, and
particularly an exceptional power of endurance in facing the
horrors of war. The Army fought without a murmur for nearly
three years. With extraordinary prowess and self-sacrifice the
men went into action with empty hands against the deadly technique<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
of the enemy. The rivers of blood shed by the rank and file atoned
for the sins of the Supreme power, the Government, the people,
and of the Army itself.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Our late Allies should never forget that in the middle
of January, 1917, the Russian Army was holding on its front 187
enemy divisions, or 49 per cent. of the enemy&rsquo;s forces operating
on the European and Asiatic fronts.</p>

<p>The old Russian Army was still strong enough to continue the
war and to win victories.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</a><br />
<span class="smcap">The Old Army and the Emperor.</span></h2>

<p>In August, 1915, the Emperor, influenced by the entourage of
the Empress and of Rasputin, decided to take the Supreme
Command of the Army. Eight Cabinet Ministers and some politicians
warned the Emperor against this dangerous step, but their
pleadings were of no avail. The official motives they adduced
were, on the one hand, the difficulty of combining the tasks of
governing the country and commanding the Army, and, on the
other, the risk of assuming responsibility for the Army at a time
when it was suffering reverses and retreating. The real motive,
however, was the fear lest the difficult position of the Army be
further imperilled by the lack of knowledge and experience of the
new Supreme C.-in-C., and that the German-Rasputin clique that
surrounded him, having already brought about the paralysis of
the Government and its conflict with the Duma, would bring about
the collapse of the Army.</p>

<p>There was a rumour, which was afterwards confirmed, that the
Emperor came to this decision partly because he feared the entourage
of the Empress, and partly because of the popularity of
the Grand Duke Nicholas, which was growing in spite of the
reverses suffered by the Army.</p>

<p>On August 23rd, an order was issued to the Army and Navy.
To the official text, the Emperor added a note in his own hand, a
facsimile of which is reproduced overleaf:</p>

<p>This decision, in spite of its intrinsic importance, produced no
strong impression upon the Army. The High Commanding
Officers and the lower grades of Commissioned Officers were well
aware that the Emperor&rsquo;s personal part in the Supreme Command
would be purely nominal, and the question in everyone&rsquo;s mind was:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who will be the Chief of Staff?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The appointment of General Alexeiev appeased the anxiety of
the officers. The rank and file cared but little for the technical
side of the Command. To them, the Czar had always been the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
Supreme Leader of the Army. One thing, however, somewhat
perturbed them: the belief had gained ground among the people
years before that the Emperor was unlucky.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/image034.png" width="600" height="494" alt="Note added by the Emperor to Army and Navy order" />
<p class="p2"><i>Translation</i>:&mdash;&ldquo;With firm faith in the grace of God, and with
unshaken assurance of final victory, let us fulfil our sacred duty
of defending Russia till the end, and let us not bring shame to
the Russian land.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Nicholas.</span>&rdquo;</p></div>

<p class="p2">In reality, it was General M. V. Alexeiev who took command
of the armed forces of Russia. In the history of the Russian war
and the Russian turmoil, General Alexeiev holds so prominent a
place that his importance cannot be gauged in a few lines.
A special historical study would be necessary in order to describe
the career of a man whose military and political activities, which
some have severely criticised and others extolled, never caused
anyone to doubt that (in the words of an Army Order to the Volunteer
Army) &ldquo;his path of martyrdom was lighted by crystalline
honesty and by a fervent love for his Mother Country&mdash;whether
great or downtrodden.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alexeiev sometimes did not display sufficient firmness in enforc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>ing
his demands, but, in respect of the independence of the
&ldquo;Stavka&rdquo; (G.H.Q.) from outside influences, he showed civic
courage which the High Officials of the old rÃ©gime, who clung to
their offices, completely lacked.</p>

<p>One day, after an official dinner at Mohilev, the Empress took
Alexeiev&rsquo;s arm, and went for a walk in the garden with him. She
mentioned Rasputin. In terms of deep emotion she tried to persuade
the General that he was wrong in his attitude towards Rasputin,
that &ldquo;the old man is a wonderful saint,&rdquo; that he was much
calumniated, that he was deeply devoted to the Imperial family,
and, last but not least, that his visit would bring luck to the
&ldquo;Stavka.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alexeiev answered dryly that, so far as he was concerned, the
question had long since been settled. Should Rasputin appear at
G.H.Q., he would immediately resign his post.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this your last word?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, certainly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Empress cut the conversation short, and left without saying
good-bye to the General, who afterwards admitted that the
incident had an ill-effect upon the Emperor&rsquo;s attitude towards him.
Contrary to the established opinion, the relations between the
Emperor and Alexeiev, outwardly perfect, were by no means intimate
or friendly, or even particularly confidential. The Emperor
loved no one except his son. Therein lies the tragedy of his life
as a man and as a ruler.</p>

<p>Several times General Alexeiev, depressed by the growth of
popular discontent with the regime and the Crown, endeavoured
to exceed the limits of a military report and to represent to the
Emperor the state of affairs in its true light. He referred to Rasputin
and to the question of a responsible Ministry. He invariably
met with the impenetrable glance, so well-known to many,
and the dry retort:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Not another word.</p>

<p>In matters of Army administration, the Emperor fully trusted
Alexeiev, and listened attentively to the General&rsquo;s long, and perhaps
even too elaborate, reports. Attentively and patiently he
listened, but these matters did not seem to appeal to him. There
were differences of opinion in regard to minor matters, appointments
to G.H.Q., new posts, etc.</p>

<p>No doubt was left in my mind as to the Emperor&rsquo;s complete
indifference in matters of high strategy after I read an important
record&mdash;that of the deliberations of a Military Council held at
G.H.Q. at the end of 1916, under the chairmanship of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
Emperor. All the Commanders-in-Chief and the high officials of
G.H.Q. were present, and the plans of the 1917 campaign and of
a general advance were discussed.</p>

<p>Every word uttered at the conference was placed on record.
One could not fail to be impressed by the dominating and guiding
part played by General Gourko&mdash;Chief of the General Staff <i>pro
tem.</i>&mdash;by the somewhat selfish designs of various Commanders-in-Chief,
who were trying to adapt strategical axioms to the special
interests of their fronts, and finally by the total indifference of
the Supreme C.-in-C.</p>

<p>Relations similar to those just described continued between the
Emperor and the Chief of Staff when General Gourko took charge
of that office while Alexeiev, who had fallen seriously ill in the
autumn of 1916, was undergoing a cure at Sevastopol, without,
however, losing touch with G.H.Q., with which he communicated
by direct wire.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Meanwhile, the struggle between the progressive block of the
Duma and the Government (General Alexeiev and the majority
of the Commanding Officers undoubtedly sympathised with the
former) was gradually becoming more and more acute. The
record of the sitting of the Duma of November 1st, 1916 (of which
the publication was prohibited and an abridged version did not
appear in the Press till the beginning of January, 1917), when
Shulgin and Miliukov delivered their historical speeches, was
circulated everywhere in the Army in the shape of typewritten
leaflets. Feeling was already running so high that these leaflets
were not concealed, but were read and provoked animated discussions
in officers&rsquo; messes. A prominent Socialist, an active worker
of the Union of Towns, who paid his first visit to the Army in
1916, said to me: &ldquo;I am amazed at the freedom with which the
worthlessness of the Government and the Court scandals are being
discussed in regiments and messes in the presence of Commanding
officers, at Army Headquarters, etc., and that in our country
of arbitrary repression ... at first it seemed to me that I
was dealing with &lsquo;agents provocateurs.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Duma had been in close connection with the Officers&rsquo; Corps
for a long time. Young officers unofficially partook in the work
of the Commission of National Defence during the period of the
reorganisation of the Army and revival of the Fleet after the
Japanese War. Gutchkov had formed a circle, in which Savitch,
Krupensky, Count Bobrinski and representatives of the officers,
headed by General Gourko, were included. Apparently, General<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
Polivanov (who afterwards played such an important part in contributing
to the disintegration of the Army, as Chairman of the
&ldquo;Polivanov Commission&rdquo;) also belonged to the circle. There was
no wish to &ldquo;undermine the foundations,&rdquo; but merely to push along
the heavy, bureaucratic van, to give impetus to the work, and
initiative to the offices of the inert Military Administration.
According to Gutchkov, the circle worked quite openly, and the
War Ministry at first even provided the members with materials.
Subsequently, however, General Sukhomlinov&rsquo;s attitude changed
abruptly, the circle came under suspicion, and people began to
call it &ldquo;The Young Turks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Commission of National Defence was, nevertheless, very
well informed. General Lukomski, who was Chief of the Mobilisation
Section, and later Assistant War Minister, told me that
reports to the Commission had to be prepared extremely carefully,
and that General Sukhomlinov, trivial and ignorant, produced a
pitiful impression on the rare occasions on which he appeared
before the Commission, and was subjected to a regular cross-examination.</p>

<p>In the course of his trial, Sukhomlinov himself recounted an
episode which illustrates this state of affairs. One day, he arrived
at a meeting of the Commission when two important military
questions were to be discussed. He was stopped by Rodzianko,<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
who said to him:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get away, get away. You are to us as a red rag to a bull.
As soon as you come, your requests are turned down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After the Galician retreat, the Duma succeeded at last in enforcing
the participation of its members in the task of placing on
a proper basis all orders for the Army, and the Unions of
Zemstvos and Towns were permitted to create the &ldquo;General Committee
for provisioning the Army.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The hard experience of the war resulted at last in the simple
scheme of mobilising the Russian industries. No sooner did this
undertaking escape from the deadening atmosphere of military
offices than it advanced with giant strides. According to official
data, in July, 1915, each Army received 33 parks of artillery instead
of the requisite 50, whereas, in September, the figure rose to 78,
owing to the fact that private factories had been brought into the
scheme. I am in a position to state, not only on the strength of
figures, but from personal experience, that, at the end of 1916, our
Army, albeit falling short of the high standards of the Allied
armies in respect of equipment, had sufficient stores of ammunition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
and supplies wherewith to begin an extensive and carefully-planned
operation along the entire front. These circumstances were duly
appreciated in the Army, and confidence in the Duma and in social
organisations was thereby increased. The conditions of internal
policy, however, were not improving. In the beginning of 1917,
out of the extremely tense atmosphere of political strife, there
arose the idea of a new remedy:</p>

<h3>&ldquo;REVOLUTION.&rdquo;</h3>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Representatives of certain Duma and social circles visited
Alexeiev, who was ill at Sevastopol. They told the General quite
frankly that a revolution was brewing. They knew what the effect
would be in the country, but they could not tell how the front
would be impressed, and wanted advice.</p>

<p>Alexeiev strongly insisted that violent changes during the war
were inadmissible, that they would constitute a deadly menace to
the front, which, according to his pessimistic view, &ldquo;was already
by no means steady,&rdquo; and pleaded against any irretrievable steps
for the sake of preserving the Army. The delegates departed,
promising to take the necessary measures in order to avert the contemplated
revolution. I do not know upon what information
General Alexeiev based his subsequent statement to the effect that
the same delegates afterwards visited Generals Brussilov and
Ruzsky, and after these generals had expressed an opposite view
to his, altered their previous decision; but the preparations for the
revolution continued.</p>

<p>It is as yet difficult to elucidate all the details of these negotiations.
Those who conducted them are silent; there are no records;
the whole matter was shrouded in secrecy, and did not reach the
bulk of the army. Certain facts, however, have been ascertained.</p>

<p>Several people approached the Emperor, and warned him of
the impending danger to the country and the dynasty&mdash;Alexeiev,
Gourko, the Archbishop Shavelski, Purishkevitch (a reactionary
member of the Duma), the Grand Dukes Nicholas Mikhailovitch
and Alexander Mikhailovitch, and the Dowager Empress. After
Rodzianko&rsquo;s visit to the Army in the autumn of 1916, copies of his
letter to the Emperor gained circulation in the Army. In that
letter the President of the Duma warned the Emperor of the grave
peril to the throne and the dynasty caused by the disastrous activities
of the Empress Alexandra in the sphere of internal policy. On
November 1st, the Grand Duke Nicholas Mikhailovitch read a letter
to the Emperor, in which he pointed out the impossible manner,
known to all classes of society, in which Ministers were appointed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
through the medium of the appalling people who surrounded the
Empress. The Grand Duke proceeded:</p>

<p>&ldquo;... If you could succeed in removing this perpetual interference,
the renascence of Russia would begin at once, and
you would recover the confidence of the vast majority of
your subjects which is now lost. When the time is ripe&mdash;and it is
at hand&mdash;you can yourself grant from the throne the desired responsibility
(of the Government) to yourself and the legislature.
This will come about naturally, easily, without any pressure from
without, and not in the same way as with the memorable act of
October 17th, 1905.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> I hesitated for a long time to tell you the
truth, but made up my mind when your mother and your sisters
persuaded me to do so. You are on the eve of new disturbances,
and, if I may say so, new attempts. Believe me, if I so strongly
emphasise the necessity for your liberation from the existing
fetters, I am doing so not for personal motives, but only in the
hope of saving you, your throne, and our beloved country from
irretrievable consequences of the gravest nature.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All these representations were of no avail.</p>

<p>Several members of the right and of the liberal wing of the
Duma and of the progressive bloc, members of the Imperial
family, and officers, joined the circle. One of the Grand Dukes
was to make a last appeal to the Emperor before active measures
were undertaken. In the event of failure, the Imperial train was
to be stopped by an armed force on its way from G.H.Q. to
Petrograd. The Emperor was to be advised to abdicate, and, in
the event of his refusal, he was to be removed by force. The
rightful heir, the Czarevitch Alexis, was to be proclaimed Emperor,
and the Grand Duke Michael, Regent.</p>

<p>At the same time, a large group of the progressive bloc of the
Duma, of representatives of Zemstvos and towns&mdash;well versed in
the activities of the circle&mdash;held several meetings, at which the
question was discussed of &ldquo;the part the Duma was to play after
the <i>coup d&rsquo;Ã©tat</i>.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> The new Ministry was then outlined, and of
the two suggested candidates for the Premiership, Rodzianko and
Prince Lvov, the latter was chosen.</p>

<p>Fate, however, decreed otherwise.</p>

<p>Before the contemplated <i>coup d&rsquo;Ã©tat</i> took place, there began,
in the words of Albert Thomas, &ldquo;the brightest, the most festive,
the most bloodless Russian Revolution.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</a><br />
<span class="smcap">The Revolution in Petrograd.</span></h2>

<p>I did not learn of the course of events in Petrograd and at
G.H.Q. until some time had elapsed, and I will refer to these
events briefly in order to preserve the continuity of my narrative.
In a telegram addressed to the Emperor by the members of the
Council of the Empire on the night of the 28th February, the state
of affairs was described as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Owing to the complete disorganisation of transport and to
the lack of necessary materials, factories have stopped working.
Forced unemployment, and the acute food crisis due to the disorganisation
of transport, have driven the popular masses to
desperation. This feeling is further intensified by hatred towards
the Government and grave suspicions against the authorities,
which have penetrated deeply into the soul of the nation. All
this has found expression in a popular rising of elemental dimensions,
and the troops are now joining the movement. The
Government, which has never been trusted in Russia, is now
utterly discredited and incapable of coping with the dangerous
situation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Preparations for the Revolution found favourable ground in
the general condition of the country, and had been made long
since. The most heterogeneous elements had taken part in these
activities; the German Government, which spared no means for
Socialist and defeatist propaganda in Russia, and especially
among the workmen; the Socialist parties, who had formed
&ldquo;cells&rdquo; among the workmen and in the regiments; undoubtedly,
too, the Protopopov Ministry, which was said to have been
provoking a rising in the streets in order to quell it by armed
force, and thus clear the intolerably tense atmosphere. It would
seem that all these forces were aiming at the same goal, which
they were trying to reach by diverse means, actuated by
diametrically opposed motives.</p>

<p>At the same time, the progressive block and social organisa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>tions
began to prepare for great events which they considered
inevitable, and other circles, in close touch with these organisations
or sharing their views, were completing the arrangements
for a &ldquo;<i>Palace coup d&rsquo;Ã©tat</i>&rdquo; as the last means of averting the
impending Revolution.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the rebellion started as an elemental force and
caught everybody unawares. Several days later, when General
Kornilov visited the Executive Committee of the Petrograd
Soviet of Workmen and Soldiers&rsquo; Deputies, prominent members
of that body incidentally explained that &ldquo;the soldiers mutinied
independently of the workmen, with whom the soldiers had not
been in touch on the eve of the rebellion,&rdquo; and that the &ldquo;mutiny
had not been prepared&mdash;hence the absence of a corresponding
administrative organ.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As regards the circles of the Duma and the social organisations,
they were prepared for a <i>coup d&rsquo;Ã©tat</i>, but not for the
Revolution. In the blazing fire of the outbreak they failed to
preserve their moral balance and judgment.</p>

<p>The first outbreak began on February 23rd, when crowds
filled the streets, meetings were held, and the speakers called for
a struggle against the hated power. This lasted till the 26th, when
the popular movement assumed gigantic proportions and there
were collisions with the police, in which machine-guns were
brought into action. On the 26th an ukaze was received proroguing
the Duma, and on the morning of the 27th the members
of the Duma decided not to leave Petrograd. On the same
morning the situation underwent a drastic change, because the
rebels were joined by the Reserve battalions of the Litovski,
Volynski, Preobrajenski, and Sapper Guards&rsquo; Regiments. They
were Reserve battalions, as the real Guards&rsquo; Regiments were then
on the South-Western Front. These battalions did not differ,
either in discipline or spirit, from any other unit of the line. In
several battalions the Commanding Officers were disconcerted,
and could not make up their minds as to their own attitude. This
wavering resulted, to a certain extent, in a loss of prestige and
authority. The troops came out into the streets without their
officers, mingled with the crowds, and were imbued with the
crowds&rsquo; psychology. Armed throngs, intoxicated with freedom,
excited to the utmost, and incensed by street orators, filled the
streets, smashed the barricades, and new crowds of waverers
joined them. Police detachments were mercilessly slaughtered.
Officers who chanced to be in the way of the crowds were disarmed
and some of them killed. The armed mob seized the
arsenal, the Fortress of Peter and Paul, and the Kresti Prison.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<p>On that decisive day there were no leaders&mdash;there was only the
tidal wave. Its terrible progress appeared to be devoid of any
definite object, plan, or watchword. The only cry that seemed to
express the general spirit was &ldquo;<i>Long live Liberty</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Somebody was bound to take the movement in hand. After
violent discussions, much indecision and wavering, that part was
assumed by the Duma. A Committee of the Duma was formed,
which proclaimed its objects on February 27th in the following
guarded words:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the strenuous circumstances of internal strife caused by
the activities of the old Government, the temporary Committee
of the members of the Duma has felt compelled to undertake the
task of restoring order in the State and in society.... The
Committee expresses its conviction that the population and
the army will render assistance in the difficult task of creating
a new Government, which will correspond to the wishes of
the population, and which will be in a position to enjoy its
confidence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that the Duma, having led the patriotic
and national struggle against the Government detested by the
people, and having accomplished great and fruitful work in the
interests of the army, had obtained recognition in the country and
in the army. The Duma now became the centre of the political
life of the country. No one else could have taken the lead in the
movement. No one else could have gained the confidence of the
country, or such rapid and full recognition as the Supreme Power,
as the power that emanated from the Duma. The Petrograd
Soviet of Workmen and Soldiers&rsquo; Deputies was fully aware of
this fact, and it did not then claim <i>officially</i> to represent the
Russian Government. Such an attitude towards the Duma at that
moment created the illusion of the <i>national</i> character of the
Provisional Government created by the Duma. Alongside,
therefore, with the troops that mingled with the armed mob and
destroyed in their trail everything reminiscent of the old power,
alongside with the units that had remained faithful to that power
and resisted the mob, regiments began to flock to the Taurida
Palace with their commanding officers, bands and banners. They
greeted the new power in the person of Rodzianko, President of
the Duma, according to the rules of the old ritual. The Taurida
Palace presented an unusual sight&mdash;legislators, bureaucrats,
soldiers, workmen, women; a chamber, a camp, a prison, a headquarters,
Ministries. Everyone foregathered there seeking protection
and salvation, demanding guidance and answers to
puzzling questions which had suddenly arisen. On the same day,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
February 27th, an announcement was made from the Taurida
Palace:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Citizens. Representatives of the workmen, soldiers and
people of Petrograd, sitting in the Duma, declare that the first
meeting of their representatives will take place at seven o&rsquo;clock
to-night on the premises of the Duma. Let the troops that have
joined the people immediately elect their representatives&mdash;one to
each company. Let the factories elect their deputies&mdash;one to each
thousand. Factories with less than a thousand workmen to elect
one deputy each.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This proclamation had a grave and fateful effect upon the entire
course of events. In the first place, it created an organ of unofficial,
but undoubtedly stronger, power alongside with the provisional
Government&mdash;the Soviet of Workmen and Soldiers&rsquo; deputies,
against which the Government proved impotent. In the second
place, it converted the political and bourgeois revolution, both
outwardly and inwardly, into a social revolution, which was unthinkable,
considering the condition of the country at that time.
Such a revolution in war time could not fail to bring about terrible
upheavals. Lastly, it established a close connection between the
Soviet, which was inclined towards Bolshevism and defeatism,
and the army, which was thus infected with a ferment which resulted
in its ultimate collapse. When the troops, fully officered,
smartly paraded before the Taurida Palace, it was only for show.
The link between the officers and the men had already been irretrievably
broken; discipline had been shattered. Henceforward,
the troops of the Petrograd district represented a kind of
Pretorian guard, whose evil force weighed heavily over the Provisional
Government. All subsequent efforts made by Gutchkov,
General Kornilov and G.H.Q. to influence them and to send them
to the front were of no avail, owing to the determined resistance
of the Soviet.</p>

<p>The position of the officers was undoubtedly tragic, as they had
to choose between loyalty to their oath, the distrust and enmity
of the men, and the dictates of practical necessity. A small portion
of the officers offered armed resistance to the mutiny, and
most of them perished. Some avoided taking any part in the
events, but the majority in the regiments, where comparative order
prevailed, tried to find in the Duma a solution of the questions which
perturbed their conscience. At a big meeting of officers held in
Petrograd on March 1st, a resolution was carried: &ldquo;To stand by
the people and unanimously to recognise the power of the Executive
Committee of the Duma, pending the convocation of the
Constituent Assembly; because a speedy organisation of order and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
of united work in the rear were necessary for the victorious end
of the war.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Owing to the unrestrained orgy of power in which the successive
rulers appointed at Rasputin&rsquo;s suggestion had indulged during their
short terms of office, there was in 1917 no political party, no class
upon which the Czarist Government could rely. Everybody considered
that Government as the enemy of the people. Extreme
Monarchists and Socialists, the united nobility, labour groups,
Grand Dukes and half-educated soldiers&mdash;all were of the same
opinion. I do not intend to examine the activities of the Government
which led to the Revolution, its struggle against the people
and against representative institutions. I will only draw a summary
of the accusations which were justly levelled by the Duma
against the Government on the eve of its downfall:</p>

<p>All the Institutions of the State and of society&mdash;the Council of
the Empire, the Duma, the nobility, the Zemstvos, the municipalities&mdash;were
under suspicion of disloyalty, and the Government was
in open opposition to them, and paralysed all their activities in
matters of statesmanship and social welfare.</p>

<p>Lawlessness and espionage had reached unheard-of proportions.
The independent Russian Courts of Justice became subservient to
&ldquo;the requirements of the political moment.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="caption">Funeral of the first victims of the March Revolution in Petrograd.</p></div>

<p>Whilst in the Allied countries all classes of society worked
whole-heartedly for the defence of their countries, in Russia that
work was repudiated with contempt, and the work was done by
unskilled and occasionally criminal hands, which resulted in such
disastrous phenomena as the activities of Sukhomlinov and Protopopov.
The Committee &ldquo;of Military Industries,&rdquo; which had
rendered great services in provisioning the Army, was being
systematically destroyed. Shortly before the Revolution its labour
section was arrested without any reason being assigned, and this
very nearly caused sanguinary disturbances in the capital.
Measures adopted by the Government without the participation
of social organisations shattered the industrial life of the country.
Transport was disorganised, and fuel was wasted. The Government
proved incapable and impotent in combating this disorder,
which was undoubtedly caused to a certain extent by the selfish
and sometimes rapacious designs of industrial magnates. The
villages were derelict. A series of wholesale mobilisations, without
any exemptions granted to classes which worked for defence,
deprived the villages of labour. Prices were unsettled, and the
big landowners were given certain privileges. Later, the grain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
contribution was gravely mismanaged. There was no exchange
of goods between towns and villages. All this resulted in the
stopping of food supplies, famine in the towns, and repression in
the villages. Government servants of all kinds were impoverished
by the tremendous rise in prices of commodities, and were
grumbling loudly.</p>

<p>Ministerial appointments were staggering in their fitfulness,
and appeared to the people as a kind of absurdity. The demands
of the country for a responsible Cabinet were voiced by the Duma
and by the best men. As late as the morning of February 27th,
the Duma considered that the granting of the minimum of the political
desiderata of Russian society was sufficient to postpone &ldquo;the
last hour in which the fate of the Mother Country and of the
dynasty was to be settled.&rdquo; Public opinion and the Press were
smothered; the Military Censorship of all internal regions (including
Moscow and Petrograd) had made the widest use of its telephones.
It was impregnable, protected by all the powers of
martial law. Ordinary censorship was no less severe. The following
striking fact was discussed in the Duma:</p>

<p>In February, 1917, a strike movement, prompted to a certain
extent by the Germans, began to spread in the factories. The
Labour members of the Military Industries Committee then
drafted a proclamation, as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;Comrades, workmen of
Petrograd, we deem it our duty to address to you an urgent request
to resume work. The labouring class, fully aware of its
present-day responsibilities, must not weaken itself by a protracted
strike. The interests of the labouring class are calling upon you
to resume work.&rdquo; In spite of Gutchkov&rsquo;s appeal to the Minister
of the Interior and to the Chief Censor, this appeal was twice
removed from the printing press, and was prohibited.</p>

<p>The question is still open for discussion and investigation as
to what proportion of the activities of the old rÃ©gime in the domain
of economics can be attributed to individuals, what to the system,
and what to the insuperable obstacles created in the country by a
devastating war. But no excuse will ever be found for stifling the
conscience, the mind, and the spirit of the people and all social
initiative. No wonder, therefore, that Moscow and the provinces
joined the Revolution without any appreciable resistance. Outside
Petrograd, where the terror of street fighting and the rowdiness
of a bloodthirsty mob were absent (there were, however, many
exceptions), the Revolution was greeted with satisfaction, and even
with enthusiasm, not only by the Revolutionary Democracy, but
by the real Democracy, the Bourgeoisie and the Civil Service.
There was tremendous animation; thousands of people thronged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
the streets. Fiery speeches were made. There was great rejoicing
at the deliverance from the terrible nightmare; there were
bright hopes for the future of Russia. There was the word:</p>

<p>&ldquo;LIBERTY.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was in the air. It was reproduced in speeches, drawings,
in music, in song. It was stimulating. It was not yet stained
by stupidity, by filth and blood.</p>

<p>Prince Eugene Troubetskoi wrote: &ldquo;This Revolution is
unique. There have been bourgeois revolutions and proletarian
revolutions, but such a national Revolution, in the broadest sense
of the word, as the present Russian Revolution, there has never
been. Everyone took part in this Revolution, everyone made it:
the proletariat, the troops, the bourgeoisie, even the nobility ...
all the live forces of the country.... May this unity endure!&rdquo;
In these words the hopes and fears of the Russian intelligencia,
not the sad Russian realities, are reflected. The cruel mutinies at
Helsingfors, Kronstadt, Reval, and the assassination of Admiral
Nepenin and of many officers were the first warnings to the
optimists.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the first days of the Revolution the victims in the Capital
were few. According to the registration of the All-Russian
Union of Towns, the total number of killed and wounded in
Petrograd was 1,443, including 869 soldiers (of whom 60 were
officers). Of course, many wounded were not registered. The
condition of Petrograd, however, out of gear and full of
inflammable material and armed men, remained for a long time
strained and unstable. I heard later from members of the Duma
and of the Government that the scales were swaying violently, and
that they felt like sitting on a powder-barrel which might explode
at any moment and blow to bits both themselves and the structure
of the new Government which they were creating. The Deputy-Chairman
of the Soviet of Workmen and Soldiers&rsquo; Deputies,
Skobelev, said to a journalist:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must confess that, when in the beginning of the Revolution,
I went to the entrance of the Taurida Palace to meet the
first band of soldiers that had come to the Duma, and when I
addressed them, I was almost certain that I was delivering one of
my last speeches, and that in the course of the next few days
I should be shot or hanged.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Several officers who had taken part in the events assured me
that disorder and the universal incapacity for understanding the
position in the Capital were so great that <i>one solid battalion</i>, com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>manded
by an officer who knew what he wanted, might have upset
the entire position. Be that as it may, the temporary Committee
of the Duma proclaimed on March 2nd the formation of a
Provisional Government. After lengthy discussions with the
parallel organs of &ldquo;Democratic Power,&rdquo; the Soviet of Workmen
and Soldiers&rsquo; Deputies, the Provisional Government issued a
declaration:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;(1) Full and immediate amnesty for all political, religious and
terrorist crimes, military mutinies and agrarian offences, etc.</p>

<p>&ldquo;(2) Freedom of speech, the Press, meetings, unions and
strikes. Political liberties to be granted to all men serving in the
Army within the limits of military requirements.</p>

<p>&ldquo;(3) Cancellation of all restrictions of class, religion and
nationality.</p>

<p>&ldquo;(4) Immediate preparation for the convocation of a
Constituent Assembly elected by universal, equal, direct and
secret suffrage for the establishment of a form of government and
of the Constitution of the country.</p>

<p>&ldquo;(5) The police to be replaced by a people&rsquo;s Militia, with
elected chiefs, subordinate to the organ of Local Self-Government.</p>

<p>&ldquo;(6) Members of Local Self-Governing Institutions to be
elected by universal, equal, direct and secret suffrage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;(7) The units of the Army that have taken part in the
Revolutionary movement are not to be disarmed or removed from
Petrograd.</p>

<p>&ldquo;(8) Military discipline to be preserved on parade and on duty.
The soldiers, however, are to be free to enjoy all social rights
enjoyed by other citizens.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Provisional Government deems it its duty to add that
it has no intention of taking advantage of wartime to delay carrying
out the aforesaid reforms and measures.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This Declaration was quite obviously drafted under pressure
from the &ldquo;parallel power.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In his book, <i>Mes Souvenirs de Guerre</i>, General Ludendorff
says: &ldquo;I often dreamt of that Revolution which was to
alleviate the burdens of our war. Eternal chimera! To-day,
however, the dream suddenly and unexpectedly came true. I felt
as if a heavy load had fallen off my shoulders. I could not, however,
foresee that it would be the grave of our might.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One of the most prominent leaders of Germany&mdash;the country
that had worked so hard for the poisoning of the soul of the
Russian people&mdash;has come to the belated conclusion that &ldquo;Our
moral collapse began with the beginning of the Russian
Revolution.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</a><br />
<span class="smcap">The Revolution and the Imperial Family.</span></h2>

<p>Alone in the Governor&rsquo;s old Palace at Mohilev the Czar
suffered in silence; his wife and children were far away, and
there was no one with him in whom he was able or willing to
confide.</p>

<p>Protopopov and the Government had at first represented the
state of affairs as serious, but not alarming&mdash;popular disturbances
to be suppressed with &ldquo;a firm hand.&rdquo; Several hundred machine-guns
had been placed at the disposal of General Habalov, Commander
of the troops of the Petrograd district. Both he and
Prince Golitzin, President of the Cabinet, had been given full
authority to make use of exceptional means of quelling the riots.
On the morning of the 27th General Ivanov had been despatched
with a small detachment of troops and a secret warrant, to be
made public after the occupation of Czarskoe Selo. The warrant
invested him with full military and civic powers. No one could
have been less fitted than General Ivanov to occupy so highly
important a position, which amounted actually to a Military
Dictatorship. Ivanov was a very old man&mdash;an honest soldier,
unfitted to cope with political complications and no longer in
possession of strength, energy, will-power, or determination....
His success in dealing with the Kronstadt disturbances
of 1906 most probably suggested his present nomination.</p>

<p>Afterwards, when looking over Habalov&rsquo;s and Bieliaiev&rsquo;s<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
reports, I was aghast at the pusillanimity and the shirking of
responsibility which they revealed.</p>

<p>The clouds continue to darken.</p>

<p>On February 26th the Empress wired to the Czar: &ldquo;Am very
anxious about the state of affairs in town....&rdquo; On the same
day Rodzianko sent his historic telegram: &ldquo;Position serious.
Anarchy in the capital. Government paralysed. Transport,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
supplies of fuel and other necessaries completely disorganised.
General discontent grows. Disorderly firing in the streets.
Military units fire at each other. Imperative necessity that some
person popular in the country should be authorised to form new
Cabinet. No delay possible. Any delay fatal. I pray God that
the Monarch be not now held responsible.&rdquo; Rodzianko forwarded
copies of his telegram to all the Commanders-in-Chief, asking
their support.</p>

<p>Early on the 27th the President of the Duma wired again to
the Czar: &ldquo;Position constantly aggravated. Measures must be
taken immediately, as to-morrow may be too late. This hour
decides the fate of our country and the dynasty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is incredible that, after this, the Czar should not have
realised the impending catastrophe, but, in the weakness and
irresolution that characterised him, it is probable that he seized
the slightest available excuse to postpone his decision, and in a
fatalistic manner, left to fate to carry out her secret decrees....</p>

<p>Be that as it may, another impressive warning from General
Alexeiev, confirmed by telegrams from the Commanders-in-Chief,
yielded no better results, and the Czar, anxious about the
fate of his family, left for Czarskoe Selo on the morning of the
29th, without coming to any final decision on the concessions to
be granted to his people.</p>

<p>General Alexeiev, although straightforward, wise, and
patriotic, was lacking in firmness, and his power and influence
with the Emperor were too slight to permit of his insisting on a
step the obvious necessity for which was evident even to the
Empress. She wired to her husband on the 27th: &ldquo;Concessions
inevitable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The futile journey was two days in accomplishment. Two
days without any correspondence or news as to the course of
events, which were developing and changing every hour....
The Imperial train, taking a roundabout course, was stopped at
Vishera by orders from Petrograd. On hearing that the Petrograd
garrison had acclaimed the Provisional Committee of the
Duma, and that the troops of Czarskoe Selo had sided with the
Revolution, the Czar returned to Pskov.</p>

<p>At Pskov, on the evening of March 1st, the Czar saw General
Ruzsky, who explained the position to him, but no decision was
arrived at, except that on the 2nd of March, at 2 a.m., the Czar
again sent for Ruzsky, and handed him an ukase, which made
the Cabinet responsible to the Duma. &ldquo;I knew that this compromise
had come too late,&rdquo; said Ruzsky to a correspondent, &ldquo;but
I had no right to express my opinion, not having received any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
instructions from the Executive Committee of the Duma, so I
suggested that the Emperor should see Rodzianko.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>All night long discussions full of deep interest and importance
to the fate of the country were held over the wire&mdash;between
Ruzsky, Rodzianko, and Alexeiev; between Headquarters and the
Commanders-in-Chief, and between Lukomsky<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> and Danilov.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>They unanimously agreed that the Abdication of the Emperor
was unavoidable.</p>

<p>Before midday on March 2nd Ruzsky communicated the
opinion of Rodzianko and the Military Commanders to the Czar.
The Emperor heard him calmly, with no sign of emotion on his
fixed, immovable countenance, but at 3 p.m. he sent Ruzsky a
signed Act of Abdication in favour of his son&mdash;a document drawn
up at Headquarters and forwarded to him at Pskov.</p>

<p>If the sequence of historical events follows immutable laws of
its own, there also seems to be a fate influencing casual happenings
of a simple, everyday nature, which otherwise seem quite
avoidable. The thirty minutes that elapsed after Ruzsky had
received the Act of Abdication materially affected the whole
course of subsequent events: before copies of the document
could be despatched, a communication, announcing the delegates
of the Duma, Gutchkov and Shulgin, was received.... The
Czar again postponed his decision and stopped the publication of
the Act.</p>

<p>The delegates arrived in the evening.</p>

<p>Amidst the complete silence of the audience,<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Gutchkov
pictured the abyss that the country was nearing, and pointed out
the only course to be taken&mdash;the abdication of the Czar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have been thinking about it all yesterday and to-day, and
have decided to abdicate,&rdquo; answered the Czar. &ldquo;Until three
o&rsquo;clock to-day I was willing to abdicate in favour of my son, but
I then came to realise that I could not bear to part with him. I
hope you will understand this? As a consequence, I have decided
to abdicate in favour of my brother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The delegates, taken aback by such an unexpected turn of
events, made no objection. Emotion kept Gutchkov silent.
&ldquo;He felt he could not intrude on paternal relations, and considered
that any pressure brought to bear upon the Emperor would
be out of place.&rdquo; Shulgin was influenced by political motives.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
&ldquo;He feared the little Czar might grow up harbouring feelings
of resentment against those who had parted him from his father
and mother; also the question whether a regent could take the oath
to the Constitution on behalf of an Emperor, who was not of age
was a matter of debate.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>&ldquo;The resentment&rdquo; of the little Czar concerned a distant
future. As to legality, the very essence of a Revolution precludes
the legality of its consequences. Also the <i>enforced</i> abdication of
Nicholas II., his rejection of the rights of inheritance of <i>his son</i>, a
minor, and, lastly, the transfer of supreme power by Michael
Alexandrovitch, a person who <i>had never</i> held it, to the Provisional
Government by means of an act, in which the Grand Duke
&ldquo;appeals&rdquo; to Russian citizens to obey the Government, are all of
doubtful legality.</p>

<p>It is not surprising that, &ldquo;in the minds of those living in those
first days of the Revolution&rdquo;&mdash;as Miliukov says&mdash;&ldquo;the new
Government, established by the Revolution, was looked upon, not
as a consequence of the acts of March 2nd and 3rd, but as a result
of the events of February 27th....&rdquo;</p>

<p>I may add that later, in the minds of many Commanding
Officers&mdash;amongst them, Kornilov, Alexeiev, Romanovsky and
Markov, who played a leading part in the attempt to save Russia&mdash;legal,
party or dynastic considerations had no place. This circumstance
is of primary importance for a proper understanding of
subsequent events.</p>

<p>About midnight on March 2nd the Czar handed Rodzianko and
Ruzsky two slightly amended copies of the Manifesto of his
Abdication.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>&ldquo;In the midst of our great conflict with a foreign enemy, who
has been striving for close on three years to enslave our country,
it has been the will of God to subject Russia to new and heavy
trials. Incipient popular disturbances now imperil the further
course of the stubborn war. The fate of Russia, the honour of
our heroic Army, the entire future of our beloved Land, demand
that the war should be carried to a victorious conclusion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The cruel foe is nearly at his last gasp, and the hour
approaches when our gallant Army, together with our glorious
Allies, will finally crush our enemy&rsquo;s resistance. In these decisive
days of Russia&rsquo;s existence we feel it our duty to further the firm
cohesion and unification of all the forces of the people, and, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
the approval of the State Duma, consider it best to abdicate the
Throne of Russia and lay down our supreme power. Not wishing
to part from our beloved Son, we transmit our inheritance to our
Brother, the Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovitch, and give him
our blessing in ascending the Throne of the Russian Empire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We command our Brother to rule the State in complete and
undisturbed union with the representatives of the people in such
Legislative Institutions as the People will see fit to establish,
binding himself by oath thereto in the name of our beloved
country.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I call all true sons of the Fatherland to fulfil their sacred
duty&mdash;to obey the Czar in this time of sore distress and help
him, together with the representatives of the people, to lead the
Russian State along the road to victory, happiness and glory.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May the Lord our God help Russia!</p>

<p class="right">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Nicholas.</span>&rdquo;
</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Late at night the Imperial train left for Mohilev. Dead
silence, lowered blinds and heavy, heavy thoughts. No one will
ever know what feelings wrestled in the breast of Nicholas II., of
the Monarch, the Father and the Man, when, on meeting Alexeiev
at Mohilev, and looking straight at the latter with kindly, tired
eyes, he said irresolutely:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>&ldquo;I have changed my mind. Please send this telegram to
Petrograd.&rdquo;</i></p>

<p><i>On a small sheet of paper, in a clear hand, the Czar had himself
traced his consent to the immediate accession to the throne of his
son, Alexis</i>....</p>

<p>Alexeiev took the telegram, and&mdash;did not send it. It was too
late; both Manifestoes had already been made public to the Army
and to the country.</p>

<p>For fear of &ldquo;unsettling public opinion,&rdquo; Alexeiev made no
mention of the telegram, and kept it in his portfolio until he passed
it on to me towards the end of May, when he resigned his post of
Supreme Commander-in-Chief. The document, of vast importance
to future biographers of the Czar, was afterwards kept under seal
at the Operations Department of General Headquarters.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Meantime, the members of the Cabinet and of the Provisional
Committee<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> had assembled at the Palace of the Grand Duke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
Michael Alexandrovitch about midday on May 3rd. Since the
27th of February, the latter had been cut off from all communication
with Headquarters or with the Emperor. But the issue of
this Conference was practically predetermined by the spirit prevailing
in the Soviet of Workmen&rsquo;s Delegates, after the gist of
the Manifesto became known to them, by the Resolution of Protest
passed by their Executive Committee and forwarded to the
Government, by Kerensky&rsquo;s uncompromising attitude, and by the
general correlation of forces. Except Miliukov and Gutchkov,
all the others, &ldquo;without the faintest desire of influencing the Grand
Duke in any way,&rdquo; eagerly advised him to abdicate. Miliukov
warned them that &ldquo;the support of a symbol familiar to the masses
is necessary, if decided authority is to be maintained, and that the
Provisional Government, if left alone, might founder in the sea
of popular disturbances, and that it might not survive until the
Convocation of the Constituent Assembly....&rdquo;</p>

<p>After another conference with Rodzianko, President of the
Duma, the Grand Duke came to his final decision to abdicate.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Declaration&rdquo; of the Grand Duke was published on the
same day:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&ldquo;A heavy burden has been laid on me by the wish of my
Brother, who has transferred the Imperial Throne of All Russia
to me at a time of unexampled warfare and popular disturbances.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Animated, together with the nation, by one thought, that the
welfare of our country must prevail over every other consideration,
I have decided to accept supreme power only if such be the
will of our great people, whose part it is to establish the form of
government and new fundamental laws of the Russian State
through their representatives in the Constituent Assembly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;With a prayer to God for His blessing, I appeal to all citizens
of the Russian State to obey the Provisional Government, which
is constituted and invested with full powers by the will of the State
Duma, until a Constituent Assembly, convoked at the earliest
possible moment by universal, direct, equal and secret suffrage,
can establish a form of government which will embody the will
of the people.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="right">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Michael.</span>&rdquo;
</p></blockquote>

<p>After his abdication, the Grand Duke resided in the neighbourhood
of Gatchino, and stood completely aloof from political life.
About the middle of March, 1918, he was arrested by order of the
local Bolshevik Committee, taken to Petrograd, and, some time
later, exiled to the Government of Perm.</p>

<p>It was rumoured that the Grand Duke, accompanied by his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
faithful English valet, had escaped about the middle of July; since
then nothing definite has been heard about him. The search
organised by the Siberian Government and by that of Southern
Russia, as also by the desire of the Dowager Empress, yielded no
certain results. The Bolsheviks, for their part, volunteered no
official information whatever. But subsequent investigations
brought some data to light which indicated that the &ldquo;release&rdquo;
was a deception, and that the Grand Duke was secretly carried off
by Bolsheviks, murdered in the vicinity of Perm, and his body
drowned under the ice.</p>

<p>The mystery of the Grand Duke&rsquo;s fate gave rise to fanciful
rumours and even to the appearance of impostors in Siberia.
During the summer of 1918, at the time of the first successful
advance of the Siberian troops, it was widely reported both in
Soviet Russia and in the South that the Siberian Anti-Bolshevist
forces were led by the Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovitch.
Periodically, until late in 1919, his spurious manifestoes appeared
in the Provincial Press, chiefly in papers of the extreme Right.</p>

<p>It must be noted, however, that when, in the summer of 1918,
the Kiev monarchists carried on an active campaign to impart a
monarchical character to the Anti-Bolshevist military movement,
they rejected the principle of legitimacy, partly because of the
personality of some of the candidates, and, in regard to Michael
Alexandrovitch, because he had &ldquo;tied himself&rdquo; by a solemn
promise to the Constituent Assembly.</p>

<p>In consideration of the complexity and confusion of the conditions
that obtained in March, 1917, I have come to the conclusion
that a struggle to retain Nicholas II. at the head of the State would
have led to anarchy, disruption of the Front, and terrible consequences,
both for the Czar and for the country. A Regency, with
Michael Alexandrovitch as Regent, might have involved conflict,
but no disturbance, and was certain of success. It would have
been more difficult to place Michael Alexandrovitch on the throne,
but even that would have been possible if a Constitution on broad,
democratic lines had been accepted by him.</p>

<p>The members of the Provisional Government and of the Provisional
Committee&mdash;Miliukov and Gutchkov excepted&mdash;terrorised
by the Soviets of Workmen&rsquo;s Delegates, and attributing
too much importance to them and to the excited workmen and
soldier masses in Petrograd, took on themselves a heavy responsibility
for the future when they persuaded the Grand Duke to
decline the immediate assumption of Supreme Power.<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p>I am not referring to Monarchism or to a particular dynasty.
These are secondary questions. I am speaking of Russia only.</p>

<p>It is certainly hard to say whether this power would have been
lasting and stable, whether it would not have undergone changes
later on; but, if it had even succeeded in maintaining the Army
during the war, the subsequent course of Russian history might
have been one of progress, and the upheavals that now endanger
her very existence might have been avoided.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On March 7th the Provisional Government issued an order
according to which &ldquo;The ex-Emperor and his Consort are deprived
of liberty, and the ex-Emperor is to be taken to Czarskoe
Selo.&rdquo; The duty of arresting the Empress was laid on Kornilov,
and orthodox Monarchists never forgave him for it. But,
strangely enough, Alexandra Fedorovna, after hearing of the
warrant, expressed her satisfaction that the renowned General
Kornilov, and not a member of the new Government, had been
sent to her.</p>

<p>The Emperor was arrested by four members of the Duma.</p>

<p>On March 8th, after leave-takings at Headquarters, the Czar
quitted Mohilev amidst the stony silence of the crowd, and under
the tearful eyes of his mother, who never saw her son again.</p>

<p>To understand the seemingly incomprehensible behaviour of
the Government to the Imperial family during the period of their
residence both at Czarskoe Selo and at Tobolsk, the following
circumstances must be kept in mind. Notwithstanding that, in
the seven and a half months of the existence of the Provisional
Government, not one single serious attempt was
made to liberate the captives, yet they attracted the
exclusive attention of the Soviet of Workmen and Soldiers&rsquo;
Delegates. On March 10th Vice-President Sokolov made
the following announcement to a unanimously approving
audience: &ldquo;I was informed yesterday that the Provisional Government
had consented to allow Nicholas II. to go to England and
that it is discussing arrangements with the British authorities without
the knowledge or the consent of the Executive Committee of
Workmen&rsquo;s and Soldiers&rsquo; Delegates. We have mobilised all the
military units that we can influence, and have taken measures to
prevent Nicholas II. from leaving Czarskoe without our permission.
Telegrams have been sent down the railway lines ...
to detain the train of Nicholas II. should it appear.... We
have despatched our Commissars with the necessary number of
troops and armoured cars, and have closely surrounded the Alexan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>der
Palace. After that we conferred with the Provisional Government,
who confirmed all our orders. At present the late Czar is
under our protection, as well as under that of the Provisional
Government....&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the 1st August, 1917, the Imperial family was exiled to
Tobolsk, and, after the establishment of Bolshevist rule in Siberia,
they were transferred to Ekaterinburg, and were the victims of incredible
insults and cruelty by the mob, until they were put to
death.<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Thus did Nicholas II. atone for his grievous sins, voluntary
and involuntary, against the Russian people.<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>In the course of the second Kuban campaign I received the
news of the death of the Emperor Nicholas II., and ordered
memorial services for the soul of the former leader of the Russian
Army to be held in the Volunteer Army. Democratic circles
and the Press criticised me severely for this.</p>

<p>The words of wisdom, <i>Vengeance is mine: I will repay</i>, were
obviously forgotten.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</a><br />
<span class="smcap">The Revolution and the Army.</span></h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">Order No. 1.</span></h3>

<p>These events found me far away from the Capital, in
Roumania, where I was commanding the Eighth Army
Corps. In our remoteness from the Mother Country we felt a
certain tension in the political atmosphere, but we certainly were
not prepared for the sudden <i>dÃ©nouement</i> or for the shape it
assumed.</p>

<p>On the morning of March 3rd I received a telegram from Army
Headquarters&mdash;&ldquo;For personal information&rdquo;&mdash;to the effect that
a mutiny had broken out in Petrograd, that the Duma had
assumed power, and that the publication of important State
documents was expected. A few hours later the wire transmitted
the manifestoes of the Emperor Nicholas the Second and
of the Grand Duke Michael. At first an order was given for their
distribution, then, much to my amazement (as the telephones had
already been spreading the news) the order was countermanded
and finally confirmed. These waverings were apparently due to
the negotiations between the temporary Committee of the Duma
and the Headquarters of the Norman Front about postponing the
publication of these Acts owing to a sudden change in the
Emperor&rsquo;s fundamental idea, namely, the substitution of the
Grand Duke Michael for the Grand Duke Alexis as Heir to the
Throne. It proved, however, impossible to delay the distribution.
The troops were thunderstruck. No other word can describe the
first impression produced by the <i>manifestoes</i>. There was neither
sorrow nor rejoicing. There was deep, thoughtful silence. Thus
did the regiments of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Divisions take
the news of the abdication of their Emperor. Only occasionally
on parade did the rifle waver and tears course down the cheeks of
old soldiers.</p>

<p>In order accurately to describe the spirit of the moment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
undimmed by the passing of time, I will quote extracts from a
letter I wrote to a near relation on March 8th:</p>

<p>&ldquo;A page of history has been turned. The first impression is
stunning because it is so unexpected and so grandiose. On the
whole, however, the troops have taken the events quietly. They
express themselves with caution; but three definite currents in the
mentality of the men can easily be traced: (1) A return to the
past is impossible; (2) the country will receive a Constitution
worthy of a great people, probably a Constitutional Limited
Monarchy; (3) German domination will come to an end and the
war will be victoriously prosecuted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Emperor&rsquo;s abdication was considered as the inevitable
result of the internal policy of the last few years. There was,
however, no irritation against the Emperor personally or against
the Imperial Family. Everything was forgiven and forgotten.
On the contrary, everyone was interested in their fate, and feared
the worst. The appointment of the Grand Duke Nicholas as
Supreme Commander-in-Chief, and of General Alexeiev as his
Chief-of-Staff, was favourably received, alike by officers and men,
and interest was manifested in the question as to whether the
Army would be represented in the Constituent Assembly. The
composition of the Provisional Government was treated more or
less as a matter of indifference. The appointment of a civilian to
the War Ministry was criticised, and it was only the part he had
taken in the Council of National Defence, and his close connection
with the officers&rsquo; circles, that mitigated the unfavourable
impression. A great many people have found it surprising and
incomprehensible that the collapse of a Monarchist rÃ©gime several
centuries old should not have provoked in the Army, bred in its
traditions, either a struggle or even isolated outbreaks, or that the
Army should not have created its own VendÃ©e.</p>

<p>I know of three cases only of stout resistance: The march of
General Ivanov&rsquo;s detachment on Czarskoe Selo, organised by
Headquarters in the first days of the risings in Petrograd, very
badly executed and soon countermanded, and two telegrams
addressed to the Emperor by the Commanding Officers of the
Third Cavalry and the Guards Cavalry Corps, Count Keller
(killed in Kiev in 1918 by Petlura&rsquo;s men) and Khan Nachitchevansky.
They both offered themselves and their troops for the
suppression of the mutiny. It would be a mistake to assume that
the Army was quite prepared to accept the provisional &ldquo;Democratic
Republic,&rdquo; that there were no &ldquo;loyal&rdquo; units or &ldquo;loyal&rdquo;
chiefs ready to engage in the struggle. They undoubtedly
existed. There were, however, two circumstances which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
exercised a restraining influence. In the first place, both Acts of
Abdication were apparently legal, and the second of these Acts, in
summoning the people to submit to the Provisional Government
&ldquo;invested with full power,&rdquo; took the wind out of the sails of the
monarchists. In the second place, it was apprehended that civil
war might open the front to the enemy. The Army was <i>then</i>
obedient to its leaders, and they&mdash;General Alexeiev and all the
Commanders-in-Chief&mdash;recognised the new power. The newly-appointed
Supreme Commander-in-Chief, the Grand Duke
Nicholas, said in his first Order of the Day: &ldquo;The power is
established in the person of the new Government. I, the Supreme
Commander-in-Chief, have recognised that power for the good of
our Mother Country, serving as an example to us of our duty as
soldiers. I order all ranks of our gallant Army and Navy
implicitly to obey the established Government through their direct
Chiefs. Only then will God grant us victory.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The days went by. I began to receive many&mdash;both slight and
important&mdash;expressions of bewilderment and questions from
the units of my corps: Who represents the Supreme Power in
Russia? Is it the temporary Committee which created the Provisional
Government, or is it the latter? I sent an inquiry, but
received no answer. The Provisional Government itself,
apparently, had no clear notion of the essence of its power.</p>

<p>For whom should we pray at Divine Service? Should we sing
the National Anthem and &ldquo;O God, Save Thy People!&rdquo; (a prayer
in which the Emperor was mentioned)?</p>

<p>These apparent trifles produced, however, a certain confusion
in the minds of the men and interfered with established military
routine. The Commanding Officers requested that the oath
should be taken as soon as possible. There was also the question
whether the Emperor Nicolas had the right to abdicate not only
for himself, but for his son, who had not yet attained his majority.</p>

<p>Other questions soon began to interest the troops. We
received the first Order of the Day of the War Minister, Gutchkov,
with alterations of the Army Regulations in favour of the
&ldquo;Democratisation of the Army&rdquo; (March 5th). By this Order,
inoffensive at first sight, the officers were not to be addressed by
the men according to their rank, and were not to speak to the men
in the second person singular. A series of petty restrictions
established by Army Regulations for the men, such as no smoking
in the streets and other public places, no card-playing, and
exclusion from Clubs and Meetings, were removed. The con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>sequences
came as a surprise to those who were ignorant of the
psychology of the rank and file. The Commanding Officers understood
that if it were necessary to do away with certain out-of-date
forms the process should be gradual and cautious, and should
by no means be interpreted as one of &ldquo;the fruits of the Revolutionary
victory.&rdquo; The bulk of the men did not trouble to
grasp the meaning of these insignificant changes in the Army
Regulations, but merely accepted them as a deliverance from
the restrictions imposed on them by routine and by respect to the
Senior Officers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is liberty, and that&rsquo;s all there is to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All these minor alterations of the Army Regulations, broadly
interpreted by the men, affected, to a certain degree, the discipline
of the army. But that soldiers should be permitted, during the
war and during the Revolution, to join in the membership of
various Unions and Societies formed for political purposes, was
a menace to the very existence of the army. G.H.Q., perturbed
by this situation, had recourse to a measure hitherto unknown in
the army&mdash;to a kind of plÃ©biscite. All Commanding Officers,
including Regimental Commanders, were advised to address
direct telegrams to the Minister of War, expressing their views
on the new orders. I do not know whether the telegraph was able
to cope with this task and whether the enormous mass of telegrams
reached their destination, but I know that those that came
to my notice were full of criticism and of fears for the future of
the army. At the same time, the Army Council in Petrograd,
consisting of Senior Generals&mdash;the would-be guardians of the
experience and traditions of the army&mdash;decided at a meeting held
on March 10th to make the following report to the Provisional
Government: &ldquo;The Army Council deems it its duty to declare
its full solidarity with the energetic measures contemplated by the
Provisional Government in re-modelling our armed forces in
accordance with the new forms of life in the country and in the
army. We are convinced that these reforms will be the best
means of achieving rapid victory and the deliverance of Europe
from the yoke of Prussian militarism.&rdquo; I cannot help sympathising
with a civilian War Minister after such an occurrence. It
was difficult for us to understand the motives by which the War
Ministry was guided in issuing its Orders of the Day. We were
unaware of the unrestrained opportunities of the men who
surrounded the War Minister, as well as of the fact that the
Provisional Government was already dominated by the Soviet and
had entered upon the path of compromise, being invariably on the
losing side. At the Congress of the Soviets on March 30th, one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
of the speakers stated that in the Conciliation Commission there
never was a case in which the Provisional Commission did not
give way on important matters.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>ON THE FIRST OF MARCH THE SOVIET OF WORKMEN
AND SOLDIERS&rsquo; DELEGATES ISSUED AN ORDER
OF THE DAY No. 1., WHICH PRACTICALLY LED TO
THE TRANSFER OF ACTUAL MILITARY POWER TO
THE SOLDIERS&rsquo; COMMITTEES, TO A SYSTEM OF
ELECTIONS AND TO THE DISMISSAL OF COMMANDING
OFFICERS BY THE MEN. THAT ORDER OF THE
DAY GAINED WIDE AND PAINFUL NOTORIETY AND
GAVE THE FIRST IMPETUS TO THE COLLAPSE OF
THE ARMY.</p>

<blockquote>

<h3><i>ORDER No. 1.</i></h3>

<p>March 1st, 1917.</p>

<p>To the Garrison of the Petrograd District, to all Guardsmen,
soldiers of the line, of the Artillery, and of the Fleet, for immediate
and strict observance, and to the workmen of Petrograd
for information.</p>

<p>The Soviet of Workmen and Soldiers&rsquo; Delegates has decreed:</p>

<p>(1) That Committees be elected of representatives of the men
in all companies, battalions, regiments, parks, batteries, squadrons
and separate services of various military institutions, and
on the ships of the fleet.</p>

<p>(2) All military units not yet represented on the Soviet of
Workmen&rsquo;s Delegates to elect one representative from each
company. These representatives to provide themselves with
written certificates and to report to the Duma at 10 <span class="small">A.M.</span> on
March 2nd.</p>

<p>(3) In all its political activities the military unit is subordinate
to the Soviet,<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> and to its Committees.</p>

<p>(4) The Orders of the Military Commission of the Duma are
to be obeyed only when they are not in contradiction with the
orders and decrees of the Soviet.</p>

<p>(5) All arms&mdash;rifles, machine-guns, armoured cars, etc.&mdash;are
to be at the disposal and under the control of Company and Battalion
Committees, and should never be handed over to the officers
even should they claim them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p>(6) On parade and on duty the soldiers must comply with strict
military discipline; but off parade and off duty, in their political,
social and private life, soldiers must suffer no restriction of the
rights common to all citizens. In particular, saluting when off
duty is abolished.</p>

<p>(7) Officers are no longer to be addressed as &ldquo;Your Excellency,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Your Honour,&rdquo; etc. Instead, they should be addressed
as &ldquo;Mr. General,&rdquo; &ldquo;Mr. Colonel,&rdquo; etc.</p>

<p>Rudeness to soldiers on the part of all ranks, and in particular
addressing them in the second person singular, is prohibited, and
any infringement of this regulation and misunderstandings between
officers and men are to be reported by the latter to the Company
Commanders.</p>

<p class="right">(Signed) <span class="smcap">The Petrograd Soviet</span>.
</p></blockquote>

<p>The leaders of the Revolutionary Democracy understood full
well the results of Order No. 1. Kerensky is reported to have
declared afterwards pathetically that he would have given ten
years of his life to prevent the Order from being signed. The
investigation made by military authorities failed to detect
the authors of this Order. Tchkeidze and other members of the
Soviet afterwards denied their personal participation and
that of the members of the Committee in the drafting of the
Order.</p>

<p>Pilates! They washed their hands of the writing of their own
Credo. For their words are placed on record, in the report of the
secret sitting of the Government, the Commanders-in-Chief and
the Executive Committee of the Workmen and Soldiers&rsquo; Deputies
of May 4th, 1917:</p>

<p><i>Tzeretelli</i>: You might, perhaps, understand Order No. 1 if
you knew the circumstances in which it was issued. We were
confronted with an unorganised mob, and we had to organise.</p>

<p><i>Skobelev</i>: I consider it necessary to explain the circumstances
in which Order No. 1. was issued. Among the troops that overthrew
the old rÃ©gime, the Commanding Officers did not join the
rebels. In order to deprive the former of their importance, we
were forced to issue Order No. 1. We had inward apprehensions
as to the attitude of the front towards the Revolution. Certain
instructions were given, which provoked our distrust. To-day
we have ascertained that this distrust was well founded.</p>

<p>A member of the Soviet, Joseph Goldenberg, Editor of <i>New
Life</i>, was still more outspoken. He said to the French journalist,
Claude Anet: (Claude Anet: <i>La RÃ©volution Russe</i>) &ldquo;Order
No. 1. was not an error, but a necessity. It was not drafted by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
Sokolov. It is the expression of the unanimous will of the Soviet.
On the day we &lsquo;made the Revolution,&rsquo; we understood that if we
did not dismember the old army, it would crush the Revolution.
We had to choose between the army and the Revolution. We did
not hesitate&mdash;we chose the latter, and I dare say that we were
right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Order No. 1. was disseminated rapidly and everywhere along
the whole front and in the rear, because the ideas which it
embodied had developed for many years, in the slums of Petrograd
as well as in the remote corners of the Empire, such as Vladivostock.
They had been preached by all local army demagogues and
were being repeated by all the delegates who visited the front
in vast numbers and were provided with certificates of immunity
by the Soviet.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The masses of the soldiery were perturbed. The movement
began in the rear, always more easily demoralised than the front,
among the half-educated clerks, doctors&rsquo; assistants, and technical
units. In the latter part of March in our units, breaches of
discipline only became more frequent. The officer in command
of the Fourth Army was expecting every hour that he would be
arrested at his Headquarters by the licentious bands of men
attached to service battalions for special duty, such as tailoring,
cooking, bootmaking, etc.</p>

<p>The text of the oath of allegiance to the Russian State was
received at last. The idea of Supreme Power was expressed in
these words: &ldquo;I swear to obey the Provisional Government now
at the head of the Russian State, pending the expression of the
popular will through the medium of the Constituent Assembly.&rdquo;
The oath was taken by the troops everywhere without any disturbance,
but the idyllic hopes of the Commanding Officers were
not fulfilled. There was no uplifting of the spirit and the perturbed
minds were not quieted. I may quote two characteristic
episodes. The Commander of one of the Corps on the Roumanian
front died of heart-failure during the ceremony. Count Keller
declared that he would not compel his corps to take the oath
because he did not understand the substance and the legal
foundations of the Supreme Power of the Provisional Government.
(Replying to a question addressed from the crowd as to
who had elected the Provisional Government, Miliukov had
answered: &ldquo;We have been elected by the Russian Revolution&rdquo;).
Count Keller said he did not understand how one could swear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
allegiance to Lvov, Kerensky and other individuals, because they
could be removed or relinquish their posts. Was the oath a sham?
I think that not only for the monarchists, but for many men who
did not look upon the oath as a mere formality, it was in any
case a great, moral drama difficult to live through. It was a heavy
sacrifice made for the sake of the country&rsquo;s salvation and for the
preservation of the army....</p>

<p>In the middle of May I was ordered to attend a Council at the
Headquarters of the General-in-Command of the Fourth Army.
A long telegram was read from General Alexeiev full of the
darkest possible pessimism, recounting the beginning of the
administrative machine and of the army. He described the demagogic
activities of the Soviet, which dominated the will-power
and the conscience of the Provisional Government, the complete
impotence of the latter and the interference of both in army
administration.</p>

<p>In order to counteract the dismemberment of the army, the
despatch was contemplated of members of the Duma and of the
Soviet, possessing a certain amount of statesmanlike experience,
to the front for purposes of propaganda....</p>

<p>This telegram impressed us all in the same way: <i>General Headquarters
had ceased to be the chief administrative authority in the
army.</i> And yet a stern warning and remonstrance from the High
Command, supported by the army, which in the first fortnight had
still retained discipline and obedience might, perhaps, have relegated
the Soviet, which over-estimated its importance, to its proper
place; might have prevented the &ldquo;democratisation&rdquo; of the army
and might have exercised a corresponding pressure upon the entire
course of political events, albeit devoid of any character of counter-revolution
or of military dictatorship. The loyalty of the Commanding
Officers and the complete absence of active resistance
on their part to the destructive policy of Petrograd exceeded all
the expectations of the Revolutionary Democracy.</p>

<p>Kornilov&rsquo;s movement came too late.</p>

<p>We drafted a reply suggesting stringent measures against intrusion
into the sphere of military administration. On March 18th
I received orders to proceed forthwith to Petrograd and to report
to the War Minister. I left on the same night and by means of
a complex system of carts, motor cars and railway carriages
arrived in the Capital after five days&rsquo; journey. On my way I
passed through the Headquarters of Generals Letchitski, Kaledin,
and Brussilov. I met many officers and many men connected with
the army. Everywhere I heard the same bitter complaint and the
same request:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell <i>them</i> that <i>they</i> are ruining the army.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The summons I had received gave no indication as to the object
of my errand. I was completely in the dark and made all kinds
of surmises. In Kiev I was struck by the cry of a newsboy who
ran past. He shouted: &ldquo;Latest news. General Denikin is
appointed Chief of the Staff of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief.&rdquo;</p>

<span class="smcap">Impressions of Petrograd at the End of March, 1917.</span></h2>

<p>Before his abdication the Emperor signed two ukazes&mdash;appointing
Prince Lvov President of the Council of
Ministers and the Grand-Duke Nicholas Supreme Commander-in-Chief.
&ldquo;In view of the general attitude towards the Romanov
Dynasty,&rdquo; as the official Petrograd papers said, and in reality for
fear of the Soviet&rsquo;s attempting a military <i>coup d&rsquo;Ã©tat</i>, the Grand-Duke
Nicholas was informed on March 9th by the Provisional
Government that it was undesirable that he should remain in
supreme command. Prince Lvov wrote: &ldquo;The situation makes
your resignation imperative. Public opinion is definitely and
resolutely opposed to any members of the House of Romanov
holding any office in the State. The Provisional Government is
not entitled to disregard the voice of the people, because such
disregard might bring about serious complications. The Provisional
Government is convinced that, for the good of the
country, you will bow to the necessity and will resign before
returning to G.H.Q.&rdquo; This letter reached the Grand-Duke when
he had already arrived at G.H.Q. Deeply offended, he immediately
handed over to General Alexeiev and replied to the
Government: &ldquo;I am glad once more to prove my love for my
country, which Russia <i>heretofore</i> has never doubted....&rdquo;</p>

<p>The very serious question then arose of who was to succeed
him. There was great excitement at G.H.Q., and all sorts of
rumours were circulated, but on the day I passed Mohilev nothing
was known. On the 23rd I reported to the War Minister Gutchkov,
whom I had never met before. He informed me that the
Government had decided to appoint General Alexeiev to the
Supreme Command. At first there had been differences of
opinion. Rodzianko and others were against Alexeiev. Rodzianko
suggested Brussilov; but now the choice had definitely
fallen on Alexeiev. The Government considered him as a man of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
lenient disposition, and deemed it necessary to reinforce the
Supreme Command by a fighting general as Chief-of-Staff. I had
been selected on condition that General Klembovski, who was then
Alexeiev&rsquo;s assistant, should remain in charge <i>pro tem.</i> until I
became familiar with the work. I had been, in part, prepared
for this offer by the news columns of the Kiev paper. Nevertheless,
I felt a certain emotion, and apprehended the vast amount
of work which was being thrust upon me so unexpectedly and the
tremendous moral responsibility inherent in such an appointment.
At great length and quite sincerely I adduced arguments against
the appointment. I said that my career had been spent among
my men and at Fighting Headquarters, that during the war I had
commanded a division and an army corps, and that I was very
anxious to continue this work at the front. I said that I had never
dealt with matters of policy, of national defence, or of administration
on such a colossal scale. The appointment, moreover, had
an unpleasant feature. It appears that Gutchkov had quite frankly
explained to Alexeiev the reasons for my appointment on behalf
of the Provisional Government, and had given the matter the
character of an ultimatum. A grave complication had thus arisen.
A Chief-of-Staff was being imposed upon the Supreme C.-in-C.,
and for motives not altogether complimentary to the latter. My
arguments, however, were unavailing. I succeeded in obtaining
a delay and the privilege of discussing the matter with General
Alexeiev before taking a definite decision. In the War Minister&rsquo;s
office I met my colleague, General Krymov, and we were both
present while the Minister&rsquo;s assistants reported on uninteresting
matters of routine. We then retired into the next room and
began to talk frankly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo; said Krymov, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t refuse the appointment.
It is absolutely necessary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He imparted to me his impressions in abrupt sentences in his
own peculiar and somewhat rough language, but with all his
usual sincerity. He had arrived on March 14th, summoned by
Gutchkov, with whom he had been on friendly terms, and they
had worked together. He was offered several prominent posts,
had asked leave to look round, and then had refused them all. &ldquo;I
saw that there was nothing for me to do in Petrograd, and I disliked
it all.&rdquo; He particularly disliked the men who surrounded
Gutchkov.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am leaving Colonel Samarine, of the General Staff, as a
Liaison Officer. There will be at least one live man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>By the irony of fate that officer whom Krymov trusted so well
afterwards played a fatal part, as he was the indirect cause of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
General&rsquo;s suicide.... Krymov was very pessimistic in his
account of the political situation:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing will come of it in any case. How can business be
done when the Soviet and the licentious soldiery hold the Government
pinioned? I offered to cleanse Petrograd in two days with
one division; but, of course, not without bloodshed. &lsquo;Not for
anything in the world,&rsquo; they said. Gutchkov refused. Prince
Lvov, with a gesture of despair, exclaimed: &lsquo;Oh! but there
would be such a commotion!&rsquo; Things will get worse. One of
these days I shall go back to my army corps. I cannot afford to
lose touch with the troops, as it is upon them that I base all my
hopes. My corps maintains complete order and, perhaps, I shall
succeed in preserving that spirit.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I had not seen Petrograd for four years. The impression
produced by the Capital was painful and strange.... To
begin with, the Hotel Astoria, where I stayed, had been ransacked.
In the hall there was a guard of rough and undisciplined sailors
of the Guards. The streets were crowded, but dirty and filled with
the new masters of the situation in khaki overcoats. Remote from
the sufferings of the front, they were &ldquo;deepening and saving&rdquo;
the Revolution. From whom? I had read a great deal about the
enthusiasm in Petrograd, but I found none. It was nowhere to
be seen. The ministers and rulers were pale, haggard, exhausted
by sleepless nights and endless speeches at meetings and councils,
by addresses to various delegations and to the mob. Their
excitement was artificial, their oratory was full of sonorous
phrases and commonplaces, of which the orators themselves were
presumably thoroughly sick. Inwardly in their heart of hearts
they were deeply anxious. No practical work was being done;
in fact, the ministers had no time to concentrate their thoughts
upon the current affairs of State in their departments. The old
bureaucratic machine, creaking and groaning, continued to work
in a haphazard manner. The old wheels were still revolving while
a new handle was being applied.</p>

<p>The officers of the regular army felt themselves to be stepsons
of the Revolution and were unable to hit upon a proper tone in
dealing with the men. Among the higher ranks, and especially
the officers of the General Staff, there appeared already a new
type of opportunist and demagogue. These men played upon the
weaknesses of the Soviet and of the new governing class of workmen
and soldiers, to flatter the instincts of the crowd, thereby
gaining their confidence and making new openings for themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
and for their careers against the background of revolutionary
turmoil. I must, however, admit that in those days the military
circles proved sufficiently stolid in spite of all the efforts to dismember
them, and that the seeds of demoralisation were not
allowed to grow. Men of the type described above, such as the
young assistant of the War Minister, Kerensky, as well as
Generals Brussilov, Cheremissov, Bonch-Bruevitch, Verkhovsky,
Admiral Maximov and others were unable to strengthen their
influence and their position with the officers.</p>

<p>The citizen of Petrograd, in the broadest sense of the word,
was by no means enthusiastic. The first enthusiasm was exhausted
and was followed by anxiety and indecision.</p>

<p>Another feature of the life in Petrograd deserves to be noticed.
Men have ceased to be themselves. Most of them seem to be
acting a part instead of living a life inspired by the new breath
of revolution. Such was the case even in the Councils of the
Provisional Government, in which the deliberations were not
altogether sincere, so I was told, owing to the presence of Kerensky,
the &ldquo;hostage of democracy.&rdquo; Tactical considerations,
caution, partisanship, anxiety for one&rsquo;s career, feelings of self-preservation,
nervousness and various other good and bad feelings
prompted men to wear blinkers and to walk about in these
blinkers as apologists for, or at least passive witnesses of, &ldquo;the
conquests of the Revolution.&rdquo; Such conquests as obviously
savoured of death and corruption. Hence the false pathos of
endless speeches and meetings; hence these seemingly strange
contradictions. Prince Lvov saying in a public speech: &ldquo;The
process of the great Russian Revolution is not yet complete, but
every day strengthens our faith in the inexhaustible creative forces
of the Russian people, in its statesmanlike wisdom and in the
greatness of its soul.&rdquo;... The same Prince Lvov bitterly
complaining to Alexeiev of the impossible conditions under which
the Provisional Government was working, owing to the rapid
growth of demagogy in the Soviet and in the country. Kerensky,
the exponent of the idea of Soldiers&rsquo; Committees, and Kerensky
sitting in his railway carriage and nervously whispering to his
adjutant: &ldquo;Send these d.... committees to h....&rdquo;
Tchkheidze and Skobelev warmly advocating full democratisation
of the army at a joint sitting of the Soviet, of the Government
and of the Commanders-in-Chief, and during an interval in private
conversation admitting the necessity of rigid military discipline
and of their own incapacity to convince the Soviet of this
necessity....</p>

<p>I repeat that even then, at the end of March, one could clearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
feel in Petrograd that the ringing of the Easter bells had lasted
too long, and that they would have done better to ring the alarm
bell. There were only two men of all those to whom I had the
occasion to speak who had no illusions whatever: Krymov and
Kornilov.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I met Kornilov for the first time on the Galician plains, near
Galtich, at the end of August, 1914, when he was appointed to
the Command of the 48th Infantry Division and myself to the
4th (Iron) Rifle Brigade. Since that day, for four months, our
troops went forward side by side as part of the 14th Corps, fighting
incessant, glorious and heavy battles, defeating the enemy, crossing
the Carpathians and invading Hungary. Owing to the wide
extent of the front we did not often meet; nevertheless, we knew
each other very well. I had already then a clear perception of Kornilov&rsquo;s
main characteristics as a leader. He had an extraordinary
capacity for training troops: out of a second-rate unit from the
district of Kazan he made, in several weeks, an excellent fighting
division. He was resolute and extremely pertinacious in conducting
the most difficult and even apparently doomed operations.
His personal prowess, which provoked boundless admiration and
gave him great popularity among the troops, was admirable.
Finally, he scrupulously observed military ethics with regard to
units fighting by his side and to his comrades-in-arms. Many
commanding officers and units lacked that quality. After Kornilov&rsquo;s
astounding escape from Austrian captivity, into which he
fell when heavily wounded, and covering Brussilov&rsquo;s retreat from
the Carpathians, towards the beginning of the Revolution, he
commanded the 25th Corps. All those who knew Kornilov even
slightly felt that he was destined to play an important part in the
Russian Revolution. On March 2nd Rodzianko telegraphed direct
to Kornilov: &ldquo;The Temporary Committee of the Duma requests
you, for your country&rsquo;s sake, to accept the chief command in
Petrograd and to arrive at the Capital at once. We have no doubt
that you will not refuse the appointment, and will thereby render
an inestimable service to the country.&rdquo; Such a revolutionary
method of appointing an officer to a high command, without
reference to G.H.Q., obviously produced a bad impression at the
&ldquo;Stavka.&rdquo; The telegram received at the &ldquo;Stavka&rdquo; is marked
&ldquo;Undelivered,&rdquo; but on the same day General Alexeiev, having
requested the permission of the Emperor, who was then at Pskov,
issued an order of the day (No. 334): &ldquo;... I agree to General<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
Kornilov being in temporary high command of the troops of the
Petrograd Military District.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I have mentioned this insignificant episode in order to explain
the somewhat abnormal relations between two prominent leaders,
which were occasioned by repeated, petty, personal friction.</p>

<p>I talked to Kornilov at dinner in the War Minister&rsquo;s house.
It was the only moment of rest he could snatch during the day.
Kornilov, tired, morose and somewhat pessimistic, discussed at
length the conditions of the Petrograd Garrison, and his intercourse
with the Soviet. The hero-worship with which he had been
surrounded in the army had faded in the unhealthy atmosphere
of the Capital among the demoralised troops. They were holding
meetings, deserting, indulging in petty commerce in shops and in
the street, serving as hall-porters and as personal guards to
private individuals, partaking in plundering and arbitrary searches,
but were not serving. It was difficult for a fighting general to understand
their psychology. He often succeeded by personal pluck,
disregard of danger, and by a witty, picturesque word in holding
the mob, for that was what military units were. There were,
however, cases when the troops did not come out of barracks
to meet their Commander-in-Chief, when he was hissed and the
flag of St. George was torn from his motor-car (by the Finland
Regiment of the Guards).</p>

<p>Kornilov&rsquo;s description of the political situation was the same
as that given by Krymov: Powerlessness of the Government and
the inevitability of a fierce cleansing of Petrograd. On one point
they differed: Kornilov stubbornly clung to the hope that he would
yet succeed in gaining authority over the majority of the Petrograd
Garrison. As we know, that hope was never fulfilled.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</a><br />
<span class="smcap">The Stavka: Its RÃ´le and Position.</span></h2>

<p>On March 25th I arrived at the Stavka, and was immediately
received by General Alexeiev. Of course he was offended.
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if such are the orders, what&rsquo;s to be done?&rdquo;
Again, as at the War Ministry, I pointed out several reasons
against my appointment, among others, my disinclination for
Staff work. I asked the General to express his views quite frankly,
and in disregard of all conventionalities as my old Professor,
because I would not think of accepting the appointment against
his will. Alexeiev spoke politely, dryly, evasively, and showed
again that he was offended. &ldquo;The scope,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;was wide,
work difficult, and much training necessary. Let us, however,
work harmoniously.&rdquo; In the course of my long career I have
never been placed in such a position, and could not, of course, be
reconciled to such an attitude. &ldquo;In these circumstances,&rdquo; I said,
&ldquo;I absolutely refuse to accept the appointment. In order to
avoid friction between yourself and the Government, I will declare
that it is entirely my own personal decision.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Alexeiev&rsquo;s tone changed immediately. &ldquo;Oh! no,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;I am not asking you to refuse. Let us work together, and I
will help you. Also, there is no reason, if you feel that the work
is not to your liking, why you should not take command of the
First Army, in which there will be a vacancy two or three months
hence. I will have to talk the matter over with General
Klembovski. He could not, of course, remain here as my
assistant.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="caption">General Kornilov.</p></div>

<p>Our parting was not quite so frigid; but a couple of days
went by and there were no results. I lived in a railway carriage,
and did not go to the office or to the mess. As I did not intend
to tolerate this silly and utterly undeserved position, I was
preparing to leave Petrograd. On March 28th the War Minister
came to the Stavka and cut the Gordian knot. Klembovski was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
offered the command of an army or membership of the War
Council. He chose the latter, and on April 5th I took charge as
Chief of the Staff. Nevertheless, such a method of appointing
the closest assistant to the Supreme Commander-in-Chief, practically
by force, could not but leave a certain trace. A kind of
shadow seemed to lie between myself and General Alexeiev, and
it did not disappear until the last stage of his tenure of office.
Alexeiev saw in my appointment a kind of tutelage on the part
of the Government. From the very first moment I was compelled
to oppose Petrograd. I served our cause and tried to shield the
Supreme C.-in-C.&mdash;and of this he was often unaware&mdash;from many
conflicts and much friction, taking them upon myself. As time
went by friendly relations of complete mutual trust were established,
and these did not cease until the day of Alexeiev&rsquo;s death.</p>

<p>On April 2nd the General received the following telegram:
&ldquo;The Provisional Government has appointed you Supreme
Commander-in-Chief. It trusts that, under your firm guidance,
the Army and the Navy will fulfil their duty to the country to the
end.&rdquo; My appointment was gazetted on April 10th.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Stavka, on the whole was not favoured. In the circles
of the Revolutionary Democracy it was considered a nest of
counter-Revolution, although such a description was utterly
undeserved. Under Alexeiev there was a loyal struggle against
the disruption of the Army. Under Brussilov&mdash;opportunism
slightly tainted with subservience to the Revolutionary Democracy.
As regards the Kornilov movement, although it was not
essentially counter-Revolutionary, it aimed, as we shall see later,
at combatting the Soviets that were half-Bolshevik. But, even
then, the loyalty of the officers of the Stavka was quite obvious.
Only a few of them took an active part in the Kornilov movement.
After the office of Supreme Commander-in-Chief was
abolished, and the new office created of Supreme Commanding
Committees, nearly all the members of the Stavka under
Kerensky, and the majority of them under Krylenko, continued
to carry on the routine work. The Army also disliked the Stavka&mdash;sometimes
wrongly, sometimes rightly&mdash;because the Army did
not quite understand the distribution of functions among the
various branches of the Service, and ascribed to the Stavka many
shortcomings in equipment, organisation, promotion, awards,
etc., whereas these questions belonged entirely to the War
Ministry and its subordinates. The Stavka had always been
somewhat out of touch with the Army. Under the comparatively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
normal and smoothly working conditions of the pre-Revolutionary
period this circumstance did not greatly prejudice the working
of the ruling mechanism; but now, when the Army was not in a
normal condition, and had been affected by the whirlwind of the
Revolution, the Stavka naturally was behind the times.</p>

<p>Finally, a certain amount of friction could not fail to arise
between the Government and the Stavka, because the latter
constantly protested against many Government measures, which
exercised a disturbing influence on the Army. There were no
other serious reasons for difference of opinion, because neither
Alexeiev nor myself, nor the various sections of the Stavka, ever
touched upon matters of internal policy. The Stavka was non-political
in the fullest sense of the word, and during the first
months of the Revolution was a perfectly reliable technical
apparatus in the hands of the Provisional Government. The
Stavka did but safeguard the highest interests of the Army, and,
within the limits of the War and of the Army, demanded that full
powers be given to the Supreme Commander-in-Chief. I may
even say that the personnel of the Stavka seemed to me to be
bureaucratic and too deeply immersed in the sphere of purely
technical interests; they were not sufficiently interested in the
political and social questions which events had brought to the fore.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In discussing the Russian strategy in the Great War, after
August, 1915, one should always bear in mind that it was the
personal strategy of General Alexeiev. He alone bears the
responsibility before history for its course, its successes and
failures. A man of exceptional conscientiousness and self-sacrifice,
and devoted to his work, he had one serious failing: all
his life he did the work of others as well as his own. So it was
when he held the post of Quartermaster-General of the General
Staff, of Chief-of-Staff of the Kiev District, and later of the South-Western
front and finally of Chief-of-Staff to the Supreme C.-in-C.
Nobody influenced strategical decisions, and, as often as not,
final instructions, written in Alexeiev&rsquo;s tiny and neat hand-writing,
appeared unexpectedly on the desk of the Quartermaster-General,
whose duty under the law and whose responsibility in
these matters were very grave. If such a procedure was to a
certain extent justifiable, when the post of Quartermaster-General
was occupied by a nonentity, there was no excuse for it when he
was superseded by other Quartermasters-General, such as
Lukomski or Josephovitch. These men could not accept such a
position. The former, as a rule, protested by sending in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
memoranda embodying his opinion, which was adverse to the plan
of operations. Such protests, of course, were purely academic,
but presented a guarantee against the judgment of history.
General Klembovski, my predecessor, was compelled to demand
non-interference with the rightful sphere of his competence as a
condition of his tenure of office. Till then, Alexeiev had directed
all the branches of administration. When these branches
acquired a still broader scope, this proved practically impossible,
and I was given full liberty in my work except ... in respect
of strategy. Again, Alexeiev began to send telegrams in his own
hand of a strategical nature, orders and directions, the motives
of which the Quartermaster-General and myself could not understand.
Several times, three of us, the Quartermaster-General,
Josephovitch, his assistant, General Markov, and myself,
discussed this question. The quick-tempered Josephovitch was
greatly excited, and asked to be appointed to a Divisional Command.
&ldquo;I cannot be a clerk,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There is no need for a
Quartermaster-General at the Stavka if every clerk can type
instructions.&rdquo; The General and myself began to contemplate
resignation. Markov said that he would not stay for a single
day if we went. I finally decided to have a frank talk with
Alexeiev. We were both under the strain of emotion. We parted
as friends, but we did not settle the question. Alexeiev said:
&ldquo;Do I not give you a full share of the work? I do not understand
you.&rdquo; Alexeiev was quite sincerely surprised because
during the war he had grown accustomed to a rÃ©gime which
appeared to him perfectly normal. So we three held another
conference. After a lengthy discussion, we decided that the plan
of campaign for 1917 had long since been worked out, that preparations
for that campaign had reached a stage in which substantial
alterations had become impossible, that the details of the concentration
and distribution of troops were in the present condition of
the Army a difficult matter, allowing for differences of opinion;
that we could perhaps manage to effect certain alterations of the
plan, and that finally our retirement <i>in corpore</i> might be detrimental
to the work, and might undermine the position of the
Supreme C.-in-C., which was already by no means stable. We
therefore decided to wait and see. We did not have to wait very
long, because, at the end of May, Alexeiev left the Stavka, and
we followed him very soon afterwards.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>What place did the Stavka occupy as a military and political
factor of the Revolutionary period?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<p>The importance of the Stavka diminished. In the days of the
Imperial rÃ©gime, the Stavka, from the military point of view,
occupied a predominant position. No individual or institution
in the State was entitled to issue instructions or to call to account
the Supreme Commander-in-Chief, and it was Alexeiev and not
the Czar who in reality held that office. Not a single measure
of the War Ministry, even if indirectly affecting the interests of
the Army, could be adopted without the sanction of the Stavka.
The Stavka gave direct orders to the War Minister and to his
Department on questions appertaining to the care of the Army.
The voice of the Stavka had a certain weight and importance in
the practical domain of administration at the theatre of war,
albeit without any connection with the general trend of internal
policy. That power was not exercised to a sufficient degree;
but on principle it afforded the opportunity of carrying on the
defence of the country in co-operation with other branches of the
administration, which were to a certain extent subordinate to it.
With the beginning of the Revolution, these conditions underwent
a radical change. Contrary to the examples of history and
to the dictates of military science, the Stavka became practically
subordinate to the War Minister. This was not due to any act
of the Government, but merely to the fact that the Provisional
Government combined supreme power with executive power, as
well as to the combination of the strong character of Gutchkov
and the yielding nature of Alexeiev. The Stavka could no
longer address rightful demands to the branches of the War
Ministry which were attending to Army equipments. It conducted
a lengthy correspondence and appealed to the Ministry of War.
The War Minister, who now signed orders instead of the Emperor,
exercised a strong influence upon appointments and dismissals of
officers in High Command. These appointments were sometimes
made by him after consultation with the fronts, but the Stavka
was not informed. Army regulations of the highest importance
altering the conditions of the troops in respect of reinforcements,
routine and duty, were issued by the Ministry without the participation
of the Supreme Command, which learnt of their issue only
from the Press. In fact, such a participation would have actually
been useless. Two products of the Polivanov Commission&mdash;the
new Courts and the Committees&mdash;which Gutchkov <i>accidentally</i>
asked me to look through, were returned with a series of substantial
objections of my own, and Gutchkov expounded them in vain
before the representatives of the Soviet. The only result was
that certain changes in the drafting of the regulations were made.</p>

<p>All these circumstances undoubtedly undermined the authority<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
of the Stavka in the eyes of the Army, and prompted the Generals
in High Command to approach the more powerful Central
Government Departments without reference to the Stavka, as well
as to display excessive individual initiative in matters of paramount
importance to the State and to the Army. Thus, in May,
1917, on the Northern Front, all the pre-War soldiers were discharged
instead of the prescribed percentage, and this created
grave difficulties on other fronts. On the South-Western Front
Ukranian units were being formed. The Admiral in command
of the Baltic Fleet ordered the officers to remove their shoulder-straps,
etc.</p>

<p>The Stavka had lost influence and power, and could no longer
occupy the commanding position of an administrative and moral
centre. This occurred at the most terrible stage of the World
War, when the Army was beginning to disintegrate, and when
not only the entire strength of the people was being put to the
test, but the necessity had arisen for a power exceptionally strong
and wide in its bearing. Meanwhile, the matter was quite
obvious: if Alexeiev and Denikin did not enjoy the confidence of
the Government, and were considered inadequate to the requirements
of the Supreme Command, they should have been superseded
by new men who did enjoy that confidence and who should
have been invested with full powers. As a matter of fact, changes
were made twice. But only the men were changed, not the
principles of the High Command. In the circumstances, when no
one actually wielded power, military power was not centred in
anybody&rsquo;s hands. Neither the Chiefs who enjoyed the reputation
of serving their country loyally and with exceptional devotion,
like Alexeiev, and later the &ldquo;Iron Chiefs,&rdquo; such as Kornilov
undoubtedly was and as Brussilov was supposed to be, nor all the
Chameleons that fed from the hand of the Socialist reformers of
the Army had any real power.</p>

<p>The entire military hierarchy was shaken to its very foundations,
though it retained all the attributes of power and the
customary routine&mdash;instructions which could not move the Armies,
orders that were never carried out, verdicts of the Courts which
were derided. The full weight of oppression, following the line
of the least resistance, fell solely upon the loyal commanding
officers, who submitted without a murmur to persecution from
above as well as from below. The Government and the War
Ministry, having abolished repressions, had recourse to a new
method of influencing the masses&mdash;to <i>appeals</i>. Appeals to the
people, to the Army, to the Cossacks, to everybody, flooded the
country, inviting all to do their duty. Unfortunately, only those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
appeals were successful that flattered the meanest instincts of the
mob, inviting it to neglect its duty. As a result, it was not
counter-Revolution, Buonapartism, or adventure, but the
elemental desire of the circles where the ideas of statesmanship
still prevailed, to restore the broken laws of warfare, that soon
gave rise to a new watchword:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Military power must be seized</i>.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>Such a task was not congenial to Alexeiev or Brussilov.
Kornilov subsequently endeavoured to undertake it, and began
independently to carry out a series of important military measures
and to address ultimatums on military questions to the Government.
At first, the only question raised was that of granting
&ldquo;full powers&rdquo; to the Supreme Command within the scope of
its competence.</p>

<p>It is interesting to compare this state of affairs with that of
the command of the armies of our powerful foe. Ludendorff,
the first Quartermaster-General of the German Army says (<i>Mes
Souvenirs de Guerre</i>): &ldquo;In peace-time the Imperial Government
exercised full power over its Departments.... When the
War began the Ministers found it difficult to get used to seeing
in G.H.Q. a power which was compelled, by the immensity of its
task, to act with greater resolution as that resolution weakened
in Berlin. Would that the Government could clearly have perceived
this simple truth.... The Government went its own
way, and never abandoned any of its designs in compliance with
the wishes of G.H.Q. On the contrary, it disregarded much that
we considered necessary for the prosecution of the War.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If we recall that in March, 1918, the deputy of the Reichstag,
Haase, was more than justified in saying that the Chancellor was
nothing but a figure-head covering the military party, and that
Ludendorff was actually governing the country, we will understand
the extent of the power which the German Command
deemed it necessary to exercise in order to win the World War.</p>

<p>I have drawn a general picture of the Stavka, such as it was
when I took charge as Chief-of-Staff. Taking the entire position
into consideration, I had two main objects in view: first, to
counteract with all my strength the influences which were disrupting
the Army, so as to preserve that Army and to hold the
Eastern Front in the world struggle; and secondly, to reinforce
the rights, the power, and the authority of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief.
A loyal struggle was at hand. In that
struggle, which only lasted two months, all sections of the Stavka
had their share.</p>

<span class="smcap">General Markov.</span></h2>

<p>The duties of the Quartermaster-General in the Stavka were
many-sided and complex. As in the European Army, it
proved therefore necessary to create the office of a second
Quartermaster-General. The first dealt merely with matters
concerning the conduct of operations. I invited General Markov
to accept this new office. His fate was linked up with mine until
his glorious death at the head of a Volunteer Division. That
Division afterwards bore with honour his name, which has become
legendary in the Volunteer Army. At the outbreak of war he
was a lecturer at the Academy of the General Staff. He went to
the war as Staff-Officer to General Alexeiev. Then he joined
the 19th Division, and in December, 1914, he served under
my command as Chief-of-Staff of the 4th Rifle Brigade, which
I then commanded. When he came to our Brigade he was
unknown and unexpected, as I had asked the Army G.H.Q. for
another man to be appointed. Immediately upon his arrival he
told me that he had recently undergone a slight operation, was
not feeling well, was unable to ride, and would not go up to the
front line. I frowned, and the Staff exchanged significant glances.
The &ldquo;Professor,&rdquo; as we afterwards often called him as a friendly
jest, was obviously out of place in our midst.</p>

<p>I started one day with my staff, all mounted, towards the line
where my riflemen were fiercely fighting, near the town of
Friestach. The enemy was upon us, and the fire was intense.
Suddenly, repeated showers of shrapnel came down upon us. We
wondered what it meant, and there was Markov gaily smiling,
openly driving to the firing line in a huge carriage. &ldquo;I was
bored staying in, so I have come to see what is going on here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From that day the ice was broken, and Markov assumed a
proper place in the family of the &ldquo;Iron Division.&rdquo; I have never
met a man who loved military work to such an extent as Markov.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
He was young (when he was killed in the summer of 1918 in
action he was only 39 years of age), impetuous, communicative,
eloquent. He knew how to approach, and closely, too, any
<i>milieu</i>&mdash;officers, soldiers, crowds&mdash;sometimes far from sympathetic,
and how to instil into them his straightforward, clear, and
indisputable articles of faith. He was very quick to grasp the
situation in battle, and made work much easier for me. Markov
had one peculiarity. He was quite exceptionally straightforward,
frank, and abrupt when attacking those who, in his opinion, did
not display adequate knowledge, energy, or pluck. While he was
at Headquarters the troops therefore viewed him (as in the
Brigade) with a certain reserve, and sometimes even with intolerance
(as in the Rostov period of the Volunteer Army). No
sooner, however, did Markov join the Division than the attitude
towards him became one of love on the part of the riflemen, or
even enthusiasm on the part of the Volunteers. The Army had
its own psychology. It would have no abruptness and blame
from Markov as a Staff Officer. But when <i>their</i> Markov, in his
usual short fur coat with his cap at the back of his head, waving
his inevitable whip, was in the rifleman&rsquo;s firing line, under the
hot fire of the enemy, he could be as violent as possible, he could
shout and swear&mdash;his words provoked sometimes sorrow, sometimes
mirth, but there was always a sincere desire to be worthy
of his praise. I recall the heavy days which the Brigade endured
in February, 1915. The Brigade was pushed forward, was surrounded
by a semi-circle of hills occupied by the enemy, who was
in a position to snipe us. The position was intolerable, the losses
were heavy, and nothing could be gained by keeping us on that
line. But the 14th Infantry Division next to us reported
to the Army H.Q.: &ldquo;Our blood runs cold at the thought of
abandoning the position and having afterwards once more to
attack the heights which have already cost us rivers of blood.&rdquo;
I remained. Matters, however, were so serious that one had to
be in close touch with the men. I moved the field H.Q. up to
the position. Count Keller, in command of our section, having
travelled for eleven hours in deep mud and over mountain paths,
arrived at that moment, and rested for a while.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us now drive up to the line.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How shall we drive? Would you come to the door, enemy
machine-guns permitting?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Count Keller left fully determined to extricate the Brigade
from the trap. The Brigade was melting away. In the rear
there was only one ramshackle bridge across the San. We were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
in the hands of fate. Will the torrent swell? If it does, the
bridge will be swept away, and our retreat will be cut off. At this
difficult moment the Colonel in command of the 13th Rifle Regiment
was severely wounded by a sniper as he was coming out
of the house where the H.Q. were stationed. All officers of his
rank having been killed, there was nobody to replace him. I was
pacing up and down the small hut, in a gloomy mood. Markov
rose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give me the 13th Regiment, sir,&rdquo; said Markov.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, with pleasure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I had already thought of doing so. But I hesitated to offer
it to Markov lest he should think it was my intention to remove
him from the Staff. Markov afterwards went with his regiment
from one victory to another. He had already earned the Cross
of St. George and the sword of St. George, but for nine months
the Stavka would not confirm his appointment, because he had
not reached the dead line of seniority.</p>

<p>I recall the days of the heavy Galician retreat, when a tidal
wave of maddened peasants, with women, children, cattle and
carts, was following the Army, burning their villages and houses....
Markov was in the rear, and was ordered promptly to
blow up the bridge at which this human tide had stopped. He
was, however, moved by the sufferings of the people, and for six
hours he fought for the bridge at the risk of being cut off, until
the last cart of the refugees had crossed the bridge.</p>

<p>His life was a perpetual fiery impulse. On one occasion I
had lost all hope of ever seeing him again. In the beginning of
September, 1915, in the course of the Lutsk operation, in which
our Division so distinguished itself, between Olyka and Klevan,
the left column commanded by Markov broke the Austrian line
and disappeared. The Austrians closed the line. During the
day we heard no news, and the night came. I was anxious for
the fate of the 13th Regiment, and rode to a high slope,
observing the enemy&rsquo;s firing line in the silent distance. Suddenly,
from afar, from the dense forest, in the far rear of the Austrians,
I heard the joyous strains of the Regimental March of
the 13th. What a relief it was!</p>

<p>&ldquo;I got into such a fix,&rdquo; said Markov afterwards, &ldquo;the devil
himself could not have known which were my riflemen and which
were Austrians. I decided to cheer up my men and to collect
them by making the band play.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Markov&rsquo;s column had smashed the enemy, had taken two
thousand prisoners and a gun, and had put the Austrians to
disorderly flight towards Lutsk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<p>In his impulsiveness he sometimes went from one extreme to
another, but, as soon as matters grew really desperate, he immediately
regained self-possession. In October, 1915, the 4th
Rifle Division was conducting the famous Chartoriisk operation,
had broken the enemy on a front about twelve miles wide and
over fifteen miles deep. Brussilov, having no reserves, hesitated
to bring up troops from another front in order to take advantage
of this break. Time was short. The Germans centred their
reserves, and they were attacking me on all sides. The situation
was difficult. Markov, from the front line, telephoned:
&ldquo;The position is peculiar. I am fighting the four quarters of
the earth. It is so hard as to be thoroughly amusing.&rdquo; Only once
did I see him in a state of utter depression, when, in the spring of
1915, near Przemyshl, he was removing from the firing line the
remnants of his companies. He was drenched with the blood of
the C.O. of the 14th Regiment, who had been standing by, and
whose head had been torn off by a shell.</p>

<p>Markov never took any personal precautions. In September,
1915, the Division was fighting in the direction of Kovel. On the
right our cavalry was operating, was moving forward irresolutely,
and was perturbing us by incredible news of the appearance
of important enemy forces on its front, on our bank of the
River Styr. Markov became annoyed with this indecision, and
reported to me: &ldquo;I went to the Styr with my orderly to give
the horses a drink. Between our line and the Styr there is no
one, neither our cavalry nor the enemy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I reported him for promotion to General&rsquo;s rank, as a reward
for several battles, but my request was not granted on the plea
that he was &ldquo;a youngster.&rdquo; Verily youth was a great defect.
In the spring of 1916 the Division was feverishly preparing for
the break-through at Lutsk. Markov made no secret of his
innermost wish: &ldquo;It is to be either one or the other&mdash;a wooden
cross or the Cross of St. George of the Third Degree.&rdquo; But the
Stavka, after several refusals, compelled him to accept &ldquo;promotion&rdquo;&mdash;once
again the office of Divisional Chief-of-Staff.
(This measure was due to a great dearth of officers of the
General Staff, because the normal activities of the Academy had
come to an end. Colonels and Generals were made to hold for
a second time and on special conditions the office of Chief of
Divisional Staff before they were appointed to Divisional Commands.)
After several months on the Caucasian Front, where
Markov suffered from inaction, he lectured for some time at the
Academy, which had then reopened, and later returned to the
Army. At the outbreak of the Revolution he was attached to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
the Commanding Officer of the Tenth Army as General for
special missions.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the beginning of March a mutiny broke out at Briansk in
the big garrison. It was attended by pogroms and by the arrest
of officers. The townfolk were terribly excited. Markov spoke
several times in the crowded Council of Military Deputies. After
tempestuous and passionate debates, he succeeded in obtaining
a resolution for restoring discipline and for freeing twenty of
those arrested. Nevertheless, after midnight several companies
in arms moved to the railway station in order to do away with
Markov and with the arrested officers. The mob was infuriated
and Markov seemed to be doomed, but his resourcefulness saved
the situation. Trying to make his voice heard above the tumult,
he addressed an impassioned appeal to the mob. The following
sentence occurred in his speech: &ldquo;Had any of my &lsquo;Iron&rsquo; Riflemen
been here, he would have told you who General Markov is.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I served in the 13th Regiment,&rdquo; came a voice from the crowd.</p>

<p>Markov pushed aside several men who were surrounding him,
advanced rapidly towards the soldier, and seized him by the scruff
of the neck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You? You? Then why don&rsquo;t you thrust the bayonet into
me? The enemy&rsquo;s bullet has spared me, so let me perish by the
hand of my own rifleman....&rdquo;</p>

<p>The mob was still more intoxicated, but with admiration.
Accompanied by tempestuous cheering, Markov and the arrested
officers left for Minsk.</p>

<p>Markov was lifted by the wave of events, and gave himself
entirely to the struggle, without a thought for himself or for his
family. Faith and despair succeeded each other in his mind; he
loved his country and felt sorry for the Army, which never ceased
to occupy a prominent place in his heart and in his mind.</p>

<p>Reference will be made more than once in the course of this
narrative to the personality of Markov, but I could not refrain
from satisfying my heart&rsquo;s desire in adding a few laurels to his
wreath&mdash;the wreath that was placed upon his tomb by two faithful
friends, with the inscription:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&ldquo;He lived and died for the good of his country.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.</a></h2>

<p class="chapsummary"><span class="smcap">The Power&mdash;The Duma&mdash;The Provisional Government&mdash;The
High Command&mdash;The Soviet of Workmen&rsquo;s and Soldiers&rsquo;
Delegates.</span></p>

<p>Russia&rsquo;s exceptional position, confronted on the one hand
with a world war and on the other with a revolution, made
the establishment of a strong power an imperative necessity.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Duma</span>, which, as I have already said, unquestionably
enjoyed the confidence of the country, refused, after lengthy and
heated discussions, to head the Revolutionary power. Temporarily
dissolved by the Imperial ukaze of February 27th, it
remained loyal, and &ldquo;did not attempt to hold an official sitting,&rdquo;
as it &ldquo;considered itself a legislative institution of the old rÃ©gime,
co-ordinated by fundamental law with the obviously doomed
remnants of autocracy.&rdquo; (Miliukov, <i>History of the Second
Russian Revolution</i>.) The subsequent decrees emanated from the
&ldquo;private conference of the members of the Duma.&rdquo; This body
elected the &ldquo;temporary Committee of the Duma,&rdquo; which
exercised supreme power in the first days of the Revolution.</p>

<p>When power was transferred to the <span class="smcap">Provisional Government</span>,
the Duma and the Committee retired to the background,
but did not cease to exist, and endeavoured to give moral support
and a <i>raison d&rsquo;Ãªtre</i> to the first three Cabinets of the Government.
On May 2nd, during the first Government crisis, the
Committee still struggled for the right to <i>appoint</i> members
of the Government; subsequently it reduced its demands to that
of the right to <i>participate</i> in the formation of the Government.
Thus, on July 7th, the Committee of the Duma protested against
its exclusion from the formation of a new Provisional Government
by Kerensky, as it considered such a course as &ldquo;legally
inadmissible and politically disastrous.&rdquo; The Duma, of course,
was fully entitled to participate in the direction of the life of the
country, as, even in the camp of its enemies, the signal service<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
was recognised which the Duma had rendered to the Revolution
&ldquo;In converting to it the entire front and all the officers&rdquo; (Stankevitch:
<i>Reminiscences</i>). There can be no doubt that, had the
Soviet taken the lead in the Revolution, there would have been a
fierce struggle against it, and the Revolution would have been
squashed. It might, perhaps, have then given the victory to the
Liberal Democracy, and would have led the country to a normal
evolutionary development. Who knows?</p>

<p>The members of the Duma themselves felt the strain of
inactivity which was at first voluntary and later compulsory. There
were many absentees, and the President of the Duma had to
combat this attitude. Nevertheless, the Duma and the Committee
were quite alive to the importance of the trend events were taking.
They issued resolutions condemning, warning, and appealing to
the common sense, the heart, and the patriotism of the people,
of the Army, and of the Government. The Duma, however, had
already been swept aside by the Revolutionary elements. Its
statesmanlike appeals, full of the clear consciousness of impending
perils, had ceased to impress the country, and were ignored by the
Government. Even a Duma so peaceable that it did not even
fight for power aroused the apprehensions of the Revolutionary
Democracy, and the Soviets led a violent campaign for the
abolition of the Council of the State and of the Duma. In August
the Duma relaxed its efforts in issuing proclamations, and when
Kerensky dissolved the Duma at the bidding of the Soviets, nineteen
days before the expiration of its five years&rsquo; term, on October
6th, this news did not produce any appreciable effect in the country.
Rodzianko kept alive for a long time the idea of the Fourth Duma
or of the Assembly of all Dumas as the foundation of the power
of the State. He stuck to this idea throughout the Kuban campaigns
and the Ekaterinodar Volunteer period of the anti-Bolshevik
struggle. But the Duma was dead....</p>

<p>None can tell whether the Duma&rsquo;s abdication of power was
inevitable in the days of March, and whether it was rendered
imperative by the relative strength of the forces that struggled
for power, whether the &ldquo;class&rdquo; Duma could have retained the
Socialist elements in its midst and have continued to wield a
certain influence in the country, acquired as a result of its fight
against autocracy. It is at least certain that, in the years of
trouble in Russia, when no normal, popular representation was
possible, all Governments invariably felt the necessity for some
substitute for this popular representation, were it only as a kind
of tribune from which expression could be given to different
currents of thought, a rock upon which to stand and to divine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
moral responsibilities. Such was the &ldquo;Temporary Council of
the Russian Republic&rdquo; at Petrograd in October, 1917, which,
however, had been started by the Revolutionary Democracy, as
a counter-blast to the contemplated Bolshevik Second Congress
of Soviets. Such was the partial constituent Assembly of 1917,
which was held on the Volga in the summer of 1918, and such
the proposed convocation of the High Council and Assembly
(<i>Sobor</i>) of the Zemstvos in the South of Russia and in Siberia in
1919. Even the highest manifestation of collective dictatorship&mdash;&ldquo;the
Soviet of People&rsquo;s Commissars&rdquo;&mdash;which reached a level
of despotism and had suppressed social life and all the live forces
of the country to an extent unknown in history, and reduced
the country to a graveyard, still considered it necessary to create
a kind of theatrical travesty of such a representative institution
by periodically convoking the &ldquo;All-Russian Congress of Soviets.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The authority of the Provisional Government contained the
seed of its own impotence. As Miliukov has said, that power was
devoid of the &ldquo;symbol&rdquo; to which the masses were accustomed.
The Government yielded to the pressure of the Soviet, which was
systematically distorting all State functions and making them subservient
to the interests of class and party.</p>

<p>Kerensky, the &ldquo;hostage of Democracy,&rdquo; was in the Government.
In a speech delivered in the Soviet he thus defined his rÃ´le:
&ldquo;I am the representative of Democracy, and the Provisional
Government should look upon me as expressing the demands of
Democracy, and should particularly heed the opinions which I
may utter.&rdquo; Last, but not least, there were in the Government
representatives of the Russian Liberal Intelligencia, with all its
good and bad qualities, and with the lack of will-power
characteristic of that class, the will-power which, by its boundless
daring, its cruelty in removing obstacles, and its tenacity in
seizing power, gives victory in the struggle for self-preservation
to class, caste and nationality. During the four years of the
Russian turmoil the Russian Intelligencia and Bourgeoisie lived
in a state of impotence and of non-resistance, and surrendered
every stronghold; they even submitted to physical extermination
and extinction. Strong will-power appeared to exist only on the
two extreme flanks of the social front. Unfortunately it was a
will to destroy and not to create. One flank has already produced
Lenin, Bronstein, Apfelbaum, Uritzki, Dzerjinski, and Peters....
The other flank, defeated in March, 1917, may not yet have
said its last word. The Russian Revolution was undoubtedly
national in its origin, being a mode of expressing the universal
protest against the old rÃ©gime. But, when the time came for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
reconstruction, two forces came into conflict which embodied and
led two different currents of political thought, two different outlooks.
According to the accepted phrase, it was a struggle
between the Bourgeoisie and the Democracy. But it would
be more correct to describe it as a struggle between
the Bourgeois and the Socialist Democracies. Both sides
derived their leading spirits from the same source&mdash;the
Russian Intelligencia&mdash;by no means numerous and heterogeneous,
not so much in respect of class and wealth as of political ideas
and methods of political contest. Both sides inadequately reflected
the thoughts of the popular masses in whose name they spoke.
At first these masses were merely an audience applauding the
actors who most appealed to its impassioned, but not altogether
idealistic, instincts. It was only after this psychological training
that the inert masses, and in particular the Army, became, in the
words of Kerensky, &ldquo;an elemental mass melted in the fire of the
Revolution and ... exercising tremendous pressure which
was felt by the entire organism of the State.&rdquo; To deny this would
be tantamount to the denial, in accordance with Tolstoi&rsquo;s doctrine,
of the influence of leaders upon the life of the people. This
theory has been completely shattered by Bolshevism, which has
conquered for a long time the masses of the people with whom
it has nothing in common and who are inimical to the Communist
creed.</p>

<p>In the first weeks of the new Government the phenomenon
became apparent, which was described in the middle of July by
the Committee of the Duma in its appeal to the Government in
the following words: &ldquo;The seizure of the power of the State by
irresponsible organisations, the creation by these organisations of
a dual power in the centre, and of the absence of power in the
country.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The power of the Soviet was also conditional in spite of a series
of Government crises and of opportunities thereby provided for
seizing that power and wielding it without opposition and unreservedly
(the Provisional Government offered no resistance).
The Revolutionary Democracy, as represented by the Soviet,
categorically declined to assume that rÃ´le because it realised quite
clearly that it lacked the strength, the knowledge, and the skill
to govern the country in which it had as yet no real support.
Tzeretelli, one of the leaders of Revolutionary Democracy, said:
&ldquo;The time is not yet ripe for the fulfilment of the ultimate aims<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
of the proletariat and for the solution of class questions....
We understand that a Bourgeois Revolution is in progress ...
as we are unable fully to attain to our bright ideal ... and we
<i>do not wish to assume that responsibility for the collapse of the
movement</i>, which we could not avoid if we made the desperate
attempt to impose our will upon events at the present moment.&rdquo;
Another representative, Nahamkes, said that they preferred &ldquo;to
compel the Government to comply with their demands by means
of perpetual organised pressure.&rdquo; A member of the Executive
Committee of the Soviet, Stankevitch, thus describes the Soviet
in his <i>Reminiscences</i>, which reflect the incorrigible idealism of a
Socialist who is off the rails and who has now reached the stage
of excusing Bolshevism, but who nevertheless impresses one as
being sincere: &ldquo;The Soviet, a gathering of illiterate soldiers,
took the lead because it asked nothing and because it was only a
screen covering what was actually complete anarchy.&rdquo; Two
thousand soldiers from the rear and eight hundred workmen from
Petrograd formed an institution which pretended to guide the
political, military, economic and social life of an enormous
country. The records of the meetings of the Soviet, as reported
in the Press, testify to the extraordinary ignorance and confusion
which reigned at these meetings. One could not help being
painfully impressed by such a &ldquo;representation&rdquo; of Russia. An
impotent and subdued anger against the Soviet was growing in
the circles of the Intelligencia, the Democratic Bourgeoisie and
the Officers. All their hatred was concentrated upon the Soviet,
which they abused in terms of excessive bitterness. That hatred,
often openly expressed, was wrongly interpreted by the Revolutionary
Democracy as abhorrence of the very <i>idea of Democratic
Representation</i>. In time the supremacy of the Petrograd Soviet,
which ascribed to itself the exceptional merit of having destroyed
the old rÃ©gime, began to wane. A vast network of Committees
and Soviets, which had flooded the country and the Army, claimed
the right to participate in the work of the State. In April, therefore,
a Congress was held of the delegates of Workmen and
Soldiers&rsquo; Soviets. The Petrograd Soviet was reorganised on the
basis of a more regular representation, and in June the All-Russian
Congress of Representatives of the Soviets was opened.
The composition of this fuller representation of Democracy is
interesting:&mdash;</p>

<p>Thus, the overwhelming masses of Non-Socialist Russia were
not represented at all; even the elements that were either non-political
or belonged to the groups of the right and were elected
by the Soviets and Army Committees as non-party members,
hastened for motives altogether in the interests of the State to
profess the Socialistic creed. In these circumstances the Revolutionary
Democracy could hardly be expected to exercise self-restraint,
and there could be no hope of keeping the popular
movement within the limits of the Bourgeois Revolution. In
reality the ramshackle helm was seized by a block of
Social Revolutionaries and Mensheviks, in which first the
former and then the latter predominated. It is that narrow
partisan block which held in bondage the will of the Government
and is primarily responsible for the subsequent course of the
Revolution.</p>

<p>The composition of the Soviet was heterogeneous: intellectuals,
bourgeoisie, workmen, soldiers and many deserters.
The Soviet and the Congresses, and especially the former, were
a somewhat inert mass, utterly devoid of political education.
Action, power and influence afterwards passed therefore into the
hands of Executive Committees in which the Socialist intellectual
elements were almost exclusively represented. The most devastating
criticism of the Executive Committee of the Soviet came
from that very institution, and was made by one of its members,
Stankevitch: the meetings were chaotic, political disorganisation,
indecision, haste, and fitfulness showed themselves in its decisions,
and there was a complete absence of administrative experience
and true democracy. One of the members advocated anarchy in
the &ldquo;Izvestia,&rdquo; another sent written permits for the expropriation
of the landlords, a third explained to a military delegation which
had complained of the Commanding Officers that these officers
should be dismissed and arrested, etc.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The most striking feature of the Committee is the preponderance
of the alien element,&rdquo; wrote Stankevitch. &ldquo;Jews,
Georgians, Letts, Poles, and Lithuanians were represented out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a><br /><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
all proportion to their numbers in Petrograd and in the
country.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a name="diag_2" id="diag_2"></a><img src="images/image090.png" width="600" height="387" alt="Russia during the turmoil." />
</div>

<p>The following is a list of the first Presidium of the All-Russian
Central Committee of the Soviets:&mdash;</p>

<ul><li>1 Georgian</li>
<li>5 Jews</li>
<li>1 Armenian</li>
<li>1 Pole</li>
<li>1 Russian (if his name was not an assumed one).</li>
</ul>

<p>This exceptional preponderance of the alien element, foreign
to the Russian national idea, could not fail to tinge the entire
activities of the Soviet with a spirit harmful to the interests of the
Russian State. The Provisional Government was the captive of
the Soviet from the very first day, as it had under-estimated the
importance and the power of that institution, and was unable to
display either determination or strength in resisting the Soviet.
The Government did not even hope for victory in that struggle,
as, in its endeavour to save the country, it could not very well
proclaim watchwords which would have suited the licentious mob
and which emanated from the Soviet. The Government talked
about duty, the Soviet about rights. The former &ldquo;prohibited,&rdquo;
the latter &ldquo;permitted.&rdquo; The Government was linked with the old
power by the inheritance of statesmanship and organisation, as
well as the external methods of administration; whereas the
Soviet, springing from mutiny and from the slums, was the direct
negation of the entire old rÃ©gime. It is a delusion to think, as a
small portion of the moderate democracy still appear to do, that
the Soviet played the part of &ldquo;restraining the tidal wave of the
people.&rdquo; <i>The Soviet did not actually destroy the Russian State,
but was shattering it, and did so to the extent of smashing the
Army and imposing Bolshevism on it.</i> Hence the duplicity and
insincerity of its activities. Apart from its declarations, all the
speeches, conversations, comments, and articles of the Soviet and
of the Executive Committee, of its groups and individuals, came
to the knowledge of the country and of the Front, and tended
towards the destruction of the authority of the Government.
Stankevitch wrote that not deliberately, but persistently, the
Committee was dealing death-blows to the Government.</p>

<p>Who, then, were the men who were trying to democratise the
Army Regulations, smashing all the foundations of the Army,
inspiring the Polivanov Commission, and tying the hands of two
War Ministers? The following is the personnel elected in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>

<p>I will leave their description to Stankevitch, who said: &ldquo;At
first hysterical, noisy, and unbalanced men were elected, who
were utterly useless to the Committee....&rdquo; New elements
were subsequently added. &ldquo;The latter tried consciously, and in
the measure of their ability, to cope with the ocean of military
matters. Two of them, however, seemed to have been inoffensive
scribes in Reserve Battalions, who had never taken the slightest
interest in the War, the Army, or the political Revolution.&rdquo; The
duplicity and the insincerity of the Soviet were clearly manifested
in regard to the War. The intellectual circles of the Left and of
the Revolutionary Democracy mostly espoused the idea of
Zimmerwald and of Internationalism. It was natural, therefore,
that the first word which the Soviet addressed on March 14, 1917,
&ldquo;To the Peoples of the Whole World,&rdquo; was:</p>

<h3>&ldquo;PEACE.&rdquo;</h3>

<p>The world problems, infinitely complex, owing to the national,
political, and economic interests of the peoples who differed in
their understanding of the Eternal Truth, could not be solved in
such an elementary fashion. Bethmann-Holweg was contemptuously
silent. On March 17th, 1917, the Reichstag, by a majority
against the votes of both Social Democratic parties, declined the
offer of peace without annexations. Noske voiced the views of
the German Democracy in saying: &ldquo;We are offered from abroad
to organise a Revolution. If we follow that advice the working
classes will come to grief.&rdquo; Among the Allies and the Allied
Democracies the Soviet manifesto provoked anxiety, bewilderment,
and discontent, which were vividly expressed in the speeches
made by Albert Thomas, Henderson, Vandervelde, and even the
present-day French Bolshevik, Cachin, upon their visits to Russia.
The Soviet subsequently added to the word &ldquo;Peace&rdquo; the definition,
&ldquo;Without annexations and indemnities on the basis of the
self-determination of peoples.&rdquo; The theory of this formula
promptly clashed with the actual question of Western and
Southern Russia occupied by the Germans; of Poland, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
Roumania, Belgium, and Serbia, devastated by the Germans; of
Alsace-Lorraine and Posen, as well as of the servitude, expropriations,
and compulsory labour which had been imposed upon all
the countries invaded by the Germans. According to the programme
of the German Social Democrats, which was at length
published in Stockholm, the French in Alsace-Lorraine, the Poles
in Posen, and the Danes in Schleswig were only to be granted
national autonomy under the sceptre of the German Emperor.
At the same time, the idea of the independence of Finland,
Russian Poland, and Ireland was strongly advocated. The
demand for the restoration of the German colonies was curiously
blended with the promises of independence for India, Siam,
Korea.</p>

<p>The sun did not rise at the bidding of Chanticleer. The <i>ballon
d&rsquo;essai</i> failed. The Soviet was forced to admit that &ldquo;time is
necessary in order that the peoples of all countries should rise,
and with an iron hand compel their rulers and capitalists to make
peace.... Meanwhile, the comrade-soldiers who have sworn
to defend Russian liberties should not refuse to advance, as this
may become a military necessity....&rdquo; The Revolutionary
Democracy was perplexed, and their attitude was clearly expressed
in the words of Tchkeidze: &ldquo;We have been preaching against
the War all the time. How can I appeal to the soldiers to continue
the War and to stay at the Front?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Be that as it may, the words &ldquo;War&rdquo; and &ldquo;Advance&rdquo; had
been uttered. They divided the Soviet Socialists into two camps,
the &ldquo;Defeatists&rdquo; and &ldquo;Defensists.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Theoretically, only the
right groups of the Social Revolutionaries, the popular Socialists,
the &ldquo;Unity&rdquo; (&ldquo;Edistvo&rdquo;) group, and the Labour party
(&ldquo;Trudoviki&rdquo;) belonged to the latter. All other Socialists advocated
the immediate cessation of the war and the &ldquo;deepening&rdquo;
of the Revolution by means of internal Class War. In practice,
when the question of the continuation of the war was put to the
vote, the Defensists were joined by the majority of the Social
Revolutionaries and of the Social Democrat Mensheviks. The
resolutions, however, bore the stamp of ambiguity&mdash;neither war
nor peace. Tzeretelli was advocating &ldquo;a movement against the
war in all countries, Allied and enemy.&rdquo; The Congress of the
Soviets at the end of May passed an equally ambiguous resolution,
which, after demanding that annexations and indemnities should
be renounced by all belligerents, pointed out that, &ldquo;so long as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
war lasts, the collapse of the Army, the weakening of its spirit,
strength and capacity for <i>active</i> operations would constitute a
strong menace to the cause of Freedom and to the vital interests
of the country.&rdquo; In the beginning of June the Second Congress
passed a new resolution. On the one hand, it emphatically
declared that &ldquo;the question of the advance should be decided
solely from the point of view of purely military and strategical
considerations&rdquo;; on the other hand, it expressed an obviously
Defeatist idea: &ldquo;Should the war end by the complete defeat of
one of the belligerent groups, this would be a source of new wars,
would increase the enmity between peoples, and would result in
their complete exhaustion, in starvation and doom.&rdquo; The Revolutionary
Democracy had obviously confused two ideas: the
<i>strategic victory</i> signifying the end of the war and <i>the terms of the
Peace Treaty</i>, which might be humane or inhuman, righteous or
unjust, far-seeing or short-sighted. In fact, what they wanted
was war and an advance, but <i>without a victory</i>. Curiously
enough, the Prussian Deputy, Strebel, the editor of <i>Vorwaerts</i>,
invented the same formula as early as in 1915. He wrote: &ldquo;I
openly profess that a complete victory of the Empire would not
benefit the Social Democracy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was not a single branch of administration with which
the Soviet and the Executive Committee did not interfere with
the same ambiguity and insincerity, due on the one hand to the
fear of any action contrary to the fundamentals of their doctrine,
and on the other to the obvious impossibility of putting these
doctrines into practice. The Soviet did not, and could not, partake
in the creative work of rebuilding the State. With regard
to Economics, Agriculture, and Labour, the activities of the Soviet
were reduced to the publication of pompous Socialist Party programmes,
which the Socialist Ministers themselves clearly
understood to be impracticable in the atmosphere of War,
Anarchy, and Economic crisis prevailing in Russia. Nevertheless,
these Resolutions and Proclamations were interpreted in the
factories and in the villages as a kind of &ldquo;Absolution.&rdquo; They
roused the passions and provoked the desire, immediately and
arbitrarily, to put them into practice. This provocation was
followed by restraining appeals. In an appeal addressed to the
sailors of Kronstadt on May 26th, 1917, the Soviet suggested
&ldquo;that they should demand immediate and implicit compliance
with all the orders of the Provisional Government given in the
interests of the Revolution and of the security of the
country....&rdquo;</p>

<p>All these literary achievements are not, however, the only form<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
of activity in which the Soviet indulged. The characteristic
feature of the Soviet and of the Executive Committee was the
complete absence of discipline in their midst. With reference
to the special Delegation of the Committee, whose object it was
to be in contact with the Provisional Government, Stankevitch
says: &ldquo;What could that Delegation do? While it was arguing
and reaching a complete agreement with the Ministers, dozens of
members of the Committee were sending letters and publishing
articles; travelling in the provinces, and at the Front in the name
of the Committee; receiving callers at the Taurida Palace, everyone
of them acting independently and taking no heed of instructions,
Resolutions, or decisions of the Committee.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Was the Central Committee of the Soviet invested with actual
power? A reply to this question can be found in the appeal of
the Organising Committee of the Labour Socialist Democratic
Party of July 17th. &ldquo;The watchword &lsquo;All-Power to the Soviets,&rsquo;
to which many workmen adhere, is a dangerous one. <i>The following
of the Soviets represents a minority in the population</i>, and we
must make every effort in order that the Bourgeois elements, who
are still willing and capable of joining us in preserving the conquests
of the Revolution, shall share with us the burdens of the
inheritance left by the old rÃ©gime, which we have shouldered, and
the enormous responsibility for the outcome of the Revolution
which we bear in the eyes of the people.&rdquo; The Soviet, and later
the All-Russian Central Committee, could not, and would not, by
reason of its composition and their political ideas, exercise a
powerful restraining influence upon the masses of the people, who
had thrown off the shackles and were perturbed and mutinous.
The movement had been inspired by the members of the Soviet,
and the influence and authority of the Soviet were, therefore,
entirely dependent on the extent to which they were able to flatter
the instincts of the masses. These masses, as Karl Kautsky, an
observer from the Marxist Camp, has said, &ldquo;were concerned
merely with their requirements and their desires as soon as they
were drawn into the Revolution, and they did not care a straw
whether their demands were practicable or beneficial to society.&rdquo;
Had the Soviet endeavoured to resist with any firmness or determination
whatsoever the pressure of the masses, it would have
run the risk of being swept away. Also, day after day and step
by step, the Soviet was coming under the influence of Anarchist
and Bolshevik ideas.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.</a></h2>

<p class="chapsummary"><span class="smcap">The Bolshevik Struggle for Power&mdash;The Power of the Army
and the Idea of a Dictatorship.</span></p>

<p>In the first period&mdash;from the beginning of the Revolution until
the <i>coup d&rsquo;Ã©tat</i> of November&mdash;the Bolsheviks were engaged
in struggling to seize power by destroying the Bourgeois rÃ©gime
and disorganising the Army, thus paving the way for the
<i>avÃ©nement</i> of Bolshevism, as Trotsky solemnly expressed it. On
the day after his arrival in Russia Lenin published his programme,
of which I will here mention the salient points:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(1) The War waged by the &ldquo;Capitalist Government&rdquo; is an
Imperialistic, plundering War. No concessions, therefore,
should be made to Revolutionary &ldquo;Defensism.&rdquo; The representatives
of that doctrine and the Army in the field should be made
clearly to understand that the War cannot end in a truly Democratic
peace, without coercion, <i>unless</i> Capitalism is destroyed.</p>

<p>The troops must fraternize with the enemy.</p>

<p>(2) The first stage of the Revolution by which the Bourgeoisie
came into power must be followed by the second stage in which
power must pass into the hands of the Proletariat and of the
poorest peasants.</p>

<p>(3) No support should be given to the Provisional Government,
and the fallacy of its promises should be exposed.</p>

<p>(4) The fact must be acknowledged that, in the majority of
the Soviets, the Bolshevik party is in a minority. The policy
must therefore be continued of criticising and exposing mistakes,
while at the same time advocating the necessity for the transfer
of Supreme Power to the Soviet.</p>

<p>(5) Russia is not a Parliamentary Republic&mdash;that would have
been a step backwards&mdash;but a Republic of the Soviets of Workmen&rsquo;s
and Peasants&rsquo; Deputies.</p>

<p>The police (Militia?), the Army, and the Civil Service must be
abolished.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>

<p>(6) With regard to the agrarian question, the Soviets of farm-labourers&rsquo;
deputies must come to the fore. All landowners&rsquo;
estates must be confiscated, and all land in Russia nationalised
and placed at the disposal of Local Soviets of Peasants&rsquo; Deputies.
The latter to be elected among the poorest peasants.</p>

<p>(7) All the banks in the country must be united in one National
Bank, controlled by the Soviet.</p>

<p>(8) Socialism must not be introduced now, but a step must be
taken towards the ultimate control by the Soviet of all industries
and of the distribution of materials.</p>

<p>(9) The State shall become a Commune, and the Socialist
Democratic Bolshevik Party shall henceforward be called &ldquo;The
Communist Party.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>I shall not dwell upon this programme, which was put into
practice, with certain reservations, in November, 1917. During
the first period the activities of the Bolsheviks, which are of great
importance, were based upon the following three principles:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(1) The overthrow of the Government and the demoralisation
of the Army.</p>

<p>(2) The promotion of class war in the country and discontent
in the villages.</p>

<p>(3) The seizure of power by the minority, which, according
to Lenin, was to be &ldquo;well-organised, armed and centralised,&rdquo;
<i>i.e.</i>, the Bolshevik party. (This was, of course, a negation of
Democratic forms of Government.)</p></blockquote>

<p>The ideas and aims of the party were, of course, beyond the
understanding not only of the ignorant Russian peasantry, but
even of the Bolshevik underlings scattered throughout the land.
The masses wanted simple and clear watchwords to be immediately
put into practice, which would satisfy their wishes and demands
arising from the turmoil of the Revolution. That &ldquo;simplified&rdquo;
Bolshevism inherent in all popular movements against the established
power in Russia was all the easier to institute in that it
had freed itself from all restraining moral influences and was
aiming primarily at destruction pure and simple, ignoring the consequences
of military defeat and of the ruin of the country. The
Provisional Government was the first target. In the Bolshevik
Press, at public meetings, in all the activities of the Soviets and
Congresses, and even in their conversations with the members of
the Provisional Government, the Bolshevik leaders stubbornly
and arrogantly advocated its removal, describing it as an instrument
of counter-Revolution and of International reaction. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
Bolsheviks, however, refrained from decisive action, as they
feared the political backwardness of the country as a whole.
They began what soldiers call &ldquo;a reconnaissance,&rdquo; and carried
it out with great intensity. They seized several private houses in
Petrograd, and organised a demonstration on the 20th and 21st
of April. That was the first &ldquo;review&rdquo; of the proletariat, at
which an estimate was made of the Bolshevik forces. The excuse
for this demonstration, in which the workmen and the troops
participated, was given by Miliukov&rsquo;s Note on International
Policy. I say <i>excuse</i> because the real reason lay in the fundamental
divergence of opinion mentioned above. Everything else
was only a pretext. As a result of the demonstration there were
great disturbances and armed conflicts in the capital, and many
casualties. The crowds carried placards bearing the inscriptions:
&ldquo;Down with the Miliukov Policy of Conquests,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Down
with the Provisional Government.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The review was a failure. In the course of the debate in the
Soviet on this occasion, the Bolsheviks demanded that the
Government be deposed, but there was a note of hesitation in
their speeches: &ldquo;The proletariat should first discuss the existing
conditions and form an estimate of its strength.&rdquo; The Soviet
passed a resolution condemning both the Government&rsquo;s policy of
conquest and the Bolshevik demonstration, while at the same time
&ldquo;congratulating the Revolutionary Democracy of Petrograd,
which had proved its intense interest in international politics by
meetings, resolutions and demonstrations.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lenin was planning another armed demonstration on a large
scale on June 10th during the Congress of the Soviets; but it was
countermanded, as the great majority of the Congress was opposed
to it. The demonstration was likewise intended as a means of
seizing power. This internal struggle between the two wings of
the Revolutionary Democracy, which were bitterly antagonistic
to one another, is extremely interesting. The Left wing made
every endeavour to induce the &ldquo;Defensist&rdquo; block, which was
preponderant, to break with the Bourgeoisie and to assume
power. The block was also resolutely opposed to such a
course.</p>

<p>Within the Soviets new combinations were coming into being.
On certain questions the Social Revolutionaries of the Left and
the Social Democrats&mdash;Internationalists&mdash;were leaning towards
the Bolsheviks. Nevertheless, until September the Bolsheviks
were not in a majority in the Petrograd Soviet or in many provincial
Soviets. It was only on September 25th that Bronstein
Trotsky succeeded Tchkeidze as Chairman of the Petrograd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
Soviet. The motto, &ldquo;All Power to the Soviets,&rdquo; sounded from
their lips like self-sacrifice or provocation. Trotsky explained
this contradiction by saying that, owing to constant re-elections,
the Soviets reflected the true (?) spirit of the masses of workmen
and soldiers, who were leaning to the Left, whereas, after the
break with the Bourgeoisie, extremist tendencies were bound to
prevail in the Soviets. As the true aspect of Bolshevism gradually
revealed itself these dissensions deepened, and were not
limited to the Social Democratic programme or to party tactics.
It was a struggle between Democracy and the Proletariat,
between the majority and a minority, which was intellectually
backward, but strong in its mutinous daring and headed by
strong and unprincipled men. It was a struggle between the
democratic principles of Universal Suffrage, political liberties,
equality, etc., and the dictatorship of a privileged class, madness,
and imminent slavery. On the 2nd July there was a second
Ministerial crisis, for which the outward cause was the disapproval
of the Liberal Ministers of the Act of Ukrainian Autonomy. On
July 3rd-5th the Bolsheviks made another riot in the Capital, in
which workmen, soldiers and sailors participated. It was done
this time on a large scale, and was accompanied by plunder and
murder. There were many victims, and the Government was in
great difficulty. Kerensky was at that time visiting us on the
Western Front. His conversations with Petrograd over the
direct wire indicated that Prince Lvov and the Government were
deeply depressed. Prince Lvov summoned Kerensky to return to
Petrograd at once, but warned him that he could not be responsible
for his safety. The rebels demanded that the Soviet and the
Central Executive Committee of the Congress should assume
power. These wings of the Revolutionary Democracy returned
another categorical refusal. The movement found no support in
the provinces, and the mutiny was quelled chiefly by the Vladimir
military school and the Cossack regiments. Several companies
of the Petrograd garrison likewise remained loyal. Bronstein
Trotsky wrote that the movement was premature because there
were too many passive and irresolute elements in the garrison;
but that it had nevertheless been proved that, &ldquo;except the cadets,
no one wanted to fight against the Bolsheviks <i>for the Government
and for the leading parties in the Soviet</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The tragedy of the Government headed by Kerensky, and of
the Soviet, lay in the fact that the masses would not follow
abstract watchwords. They proved equally indifferent to the
country and to the Revolution, as well as to the International,
and had no intention of shedding their blood and sacrificing their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
lives for any of these ideas. The crowd followed those who gave
practical promises and flattered its instincts.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When we speak of &ldquo;power,&rdquo; with reference to the first period
of the Russian Revolution, we actually mean only its outward
forms; for under the exceptional conditions imposed by a World
War on a scale unequalled in history, when 20 per cent. of the
entire male population was under arms, the power was really
concentrated in the hands of the Army. That Army had been led
astray, had been demoralised by false doctrines, had lost all sense
of duty, and all fear of authority. Last, but not least, it had no
leader. The Government, Kerensky, the Commanding Corps, the
Soviet, Regimental Committees&mdash;for many reasons none of these
could claim that title. The dissensions between all these contending
forces were reflected in the minds of the men, and hastened
the ruin of the Army. It is useless to make any surmises which
cannot be proved by realities, especially in the absence of historical
perspective; but there can be no doubt the question, whether or not
it would have been possible to erect a dam which would have
stemmed the tide and preserved discipline in the Army, will continue
to arouse attention. Personally, I believe that it was
possible. At first the Supreme Command might have done it,
as well as the Government, had it shown sufficient resolve to squash
the Soviets or sufficient strength and wisdom to draw them into
the orbit of statesmanship and of truly democratic constructive
work.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that, in the beginning of the Revolution,
the Government was recognised by all the sane elements of
the population. The High Command, the officers, many regiments,
the Bourgeoisie, and those Democratic elements which
had not been led astray by militant Socialism adhered to the
Government. The Press in those days was full of telegrams,
addresses and appeals from all parts of Russia, from various
Social, Military and class organisations and institutions whose
democratic attitude was undoubted.</p>

<p>As the Government weakened and was driven into two successive
coalitions, that confidence correspondingly decreased and
could not find compensation in fuller recognition by the Revolutionary
Democracy; because anarchist tendencies, repudiating all
authority, were gaining ground within these circles. In the
beginning of May, after the armed rising in the streets of Petro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>grad,
which took place without the knowledge of the Soviet, but
with the participation of its members; after the resignation of
Miliukov and Gutchkov, the complete impotence of the Provisional
Government became so clearly apparent that Prince
Lvov appealed to the Soviet, with the consent of the Duma Committee
and of the Constitutional Democratic Party. He invited
&ldquo;the active creative forces of the country to participate directly
in the government which had hitherto refrained from any such
participation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After some hesitation, the Soviet deemed it necessary to accept
the offer, thereby assuming direct responsibility for the fate of
the revolution. (Four members of the Soviet accepted Ministerial
posts.) The Soviet declined to assume full power &ldquo;because the
transfer of power to the Soviets in that period of the revolution
would have weakened it and would have prematurely estranged
the elements capable of serving it, which would constitute a menace
to the revolution.&rdquo; The impression produced by such declarations
upon the Bourgeoisie and upon the &ldquo;hostages&rdquo; in the Coalition
Government can be imagined. Although the Soviet expressed
full confidence in the Government and appealed to the democracy
to grant it full support, which would guarantee the authority of
the Government, that Government was already irretrievably discredited.
The Socialist circles which had sent their representatives
to join it neither altered nor strengthened its intellectual level.
On the contrary, it was weakened, inasmuch as the gulf was
widened which separated the two political groups represented in
the Government. While officially expressing confidence in the
Government, the Soviet continued to undermine its power and
became somewhat lukewarm towards the Socialist Ministers, who
had been compelled by circumstances to deviate, to a certain
extent, from the programme of the Socialist party. The people
and the Army did not pay much attention to these events, as they
were beginning to forget that there was any power at all, owing
to the fact that the existence of that power had no bearing upon
their everyday life.</p>

<p>The blood shed during the Petrograd rising organised by the
anarchist-Bolshevik section of the Soviet on July 4th-5th, Prince
Lvov&rsquo;s resignation, and the formation of a new coalition in which
the Socialists, nominated by the Soviet, definitely predominated
were but stepping stones towards the complete collapse of the
power of the State. As I have already said, the first Government
crisis was occasioned by events which, however important politically,
were only &ldquo;excuses.&rdquo; In the new Coalition the Democratic
Bourgeoisie played but a secondary part, and its &ldquo;temporary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>&rdquo;
assistance was only required in order that responsibility might
be shared; while everything was decided behind the curtain, in the
circles closely connected with the Soviet. Such a coalition could
have no vitality and could not reconcile even the opportunist
elements of the Bourgeoisie with the Revolutionary Democracy.
Apart from political and social considerations, the relative strength
of the forces which were brought into play was influenced by the
growing discontent of the masses with the activities of the Government
owing to the general condition of the country. The masses
accepted the revolution not as an arduous, transitory period,
linked up with the past and present political development of Russia
and of the world, but as an independent reality of the day, carrying
in its trail real calamities such as the War, banditism, lawlessness,
stoppage of industry, cold and hunger. The masses were unable
to grasp the situation in its complex entirety and could not differentiate
between elemental, inevitable phenomena inherent in
all revolutions and the will for good or evil of departments of
the Government, institutions or individuals. They felt that the
situation was intolerable and tried to find a remedy. As a result
of the universal recognition of the impotence of the existing
power, a new idea began to occupy the minds of the people:</p>

<h3>A DICTATORSHIP.</h3>

<p>I emphatically declare that in the social and military circles with
which I was in touch the tendency towards a dictatorship was
prompted by a patriotic and clear consciousness of the abyss into
which the Russian people was rapidly sinking. <i>It was not in
the slightest degree inspired by any reactionary or counter-revolutionary
motives.</i> There can be no doubt that the movement
found adherents among the reactionaries and among mere
opportunists; but both these elements were accessory and insignificant.
Kerensky thus interpreted the rise of the movement
which he described as &ldquo;the tide of conspiracy&rdquo;: &ldquo;The Tarnopol
defeat created a movement in favour of conspiracies, while the
Bolshevik rising of July demonstrated to the uninitiated the <i>depth
of the disruption of Democracy, the impotence of the revolution</i>
against anarchy, as well as the strength of the organised minority
which acted spontaneously.&rdquo; It would be difficult to find a better
excuse for the movement. In the atmosphere of popular
discontent, universal disorder and approaching anarchy, endeavours
at creating a dictatorship were the natural outcome of
the existing conditions. These endeavours had their origin in a
search for a <i>strong national and democratic power, but not a
reactionary one</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>

<p>On the whole the Revolutionary Democracy lived in an atmosphere
poisoned by the fear of a counter-revolution. All its cares,
measures, resolutions and appeals, as well as the disruption of the
Army and the abolition of the police in the villages, tended towards
a struggle with this imaginary foe, which was supposed to menace
the conquests of the revolution. Were the conscious leaders of
the Soviet really convinced that such a danger existed, or were
they fanning this unfounded fear as a tactical move? I am
inclined to accept the second solution, because it was quite obvious,
not only to myself, but to the Soviet as well, that the activities
of the Democratic Bourgeoisie meant not counter-revolution, but
merely opposition. And yet in the Russian partisan press and in
wide circles outside Russia it is precisely in the former sense that
the pre-November period of the Revolution was interpreted. The
Provisional Government proclaimed a broad, Democratic programme
upon its formation. In the circles of the Right this
programme was criticised and there was discontent; but no active
opposition. In the first four or five months after the beginning
of the Revolution there was not a single important counter-revolutionary
organisation in the country. These organisations
became more or less active and other secret circles, especially
officers&rsquo; circles, were formed in July in connection with the plans
for a Dictatorship. There can be no doubt that many people with
pronounced tendencies towards a restoration joined these circles.
But their main object was to combat the unofficial government,
which was a class government, as well as the personnel of the
Soviet and the Executive Committee. Had these circles not
collapsed prematurely owing to their weakness, numerical insignificance
and lack of organisation, some of the members of
those institutions might very possibly have been destroyed.
While constantly resisting counter-revolution from the Right, the
Soviet gave every opportunity for the preparations for a real
counter-revolution emanating from its own midst, from the
Bolsheviks.</p>

<p>I remember that different persons who came to the Stavka began
to discuss the question of a dictatorship and to throw out feelers,
as it were, approximately in the beginning of June. All these
conversations were stereotyped to such an extent that I have no
difficulty in summarising them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Russia is moving towards inevitable ruin. The Government
is utterly powerless. We must have a strong power. Sooner or
later we shall have to come to a Dictatorship.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nobody mentioned restoration or a change of policy in a
reactionary direction. The names were mentioned of Kornilov<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
and Brussilov. I warned them against hasty decisions. I must
confess that we still entertained the illusory hope that the Government&mdash;by
internal evolution, under the influence of a new, armed
demonstration on the part of the anti-National extremist elements
towards which they were so lenient&mdash;would realise the futility and
hopelessness of continuing in their present position and would come
to the idea of power vested in one man, which might be achieved
in a constitutional manner. The future seemed pregnant with
disaster in the absence of a truly lawful power. I pointed out that
there were no military leaders enjoying sufficient authority with
the demoralised soldiery, but that if a military dictatorship should
become necessary for the State and practicable, Kornilov was
already very much respected by the officers, whereas Brussilov&rsquo;s
reputation had been injured by his opportunism.</p>

<p>In his book Kerensky says that &ldquo;Cossack circles and certain
politicians&rdquo; had suggested repeatedly to him that the impotent
Government should be replaced by a personal dictatorship. It
was only when society was disappointed in him as the &ldquo;possible
organiser and chief agent for altering the system of Government&rdquo;
that &ldquo;a search began for another individual.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that the men and social circles that
appealed to Kerensky in the question of a dictatorship were
not his apologists and did not belong to the &ldquo;Revolutionary
Democracy,&rdquo; but the mere fact of their appeal is sufficient
proof that their motives could not have been reactionary,
and that it reflected the sincere desire of the Russian patriotic
elements to see a strong man at the helm in days of storm
and strife.</p>

<p>Perhaps there may also have been another motive; there had
been a short period, approximately in June, when not only the
Russian public, but also the officers had succumbed to the charm
of the War Minister&rsquo;s impassioned oratory and pathos. The
Russian officers, who were being sacrificed wholesale, had forgotten
and forgiven and were desperately hoping that he would
save the Russian Army. And their promise to die in the front
line was by no means an empty one. During Kerensky&rsquo;s visits
to the front, it was a painful sight to see these doomed men, their
eyes shining with exaltation, and their hearts beating with hope,
a hope that was destined to be so bitterly and mercilessly
disappointed.</p>

<p>It is to be noted that Kerensky, seeking in his book to justify
the temporary &ldquo;concentration of power&rdquo; which he assumed on
August 27th, says: &ldquo;In the struggle against the conspiracy
conducted by a single will, the State was compelled to set against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
it a will capable of resolute and quick action. No collective power,
much less a Coalition, can possess such a single will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I think that the internal condition of the Russian State
threatened with a monstrous joint conspiracy of the German
General Staff and the anti-national and anti-constitutional elements
of the Russian exiles was sufficiently grave to warrant the demand
for a strong power &ldquo;capable of resolute and quick action.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="chapsummary"><span class="smcap">The Activities of the Provisional Government&mdash;Internal
Politics, Civil Administration&mdash;The Town, the Village
and the Agrarian Problem</span>.</p>

<p>I will deal in this and in the subsequent chapters with the
internal condition of Russia in the first period of the
Revolution only in so far as it affected the conduct of the World
War. I have already mentioned the duality of the Supreme
Administration of the country and the incessant pressure of the
Soviet upon the Provisional Government. A member of the
Duma, Mr. Shulgin, wittily remarked: &ldquo;The old rÃ©gime is interned
in the fortress of Peter and Paul, and the new one is under
domiciliary arrest.&rdquo; The Provisional Government did not represent
the people as a whole; it could not and would not forestall
the will of the Constituent Assembly by introducing reforms which
would shake the political and social structure of the State to its
very foundations. It proclaimed that &ldquo;not violence and compulsion,
but the voluntary obedience of free citizens to the power
which they had themselves created, constituted the foundation
of the new administration of the State. Not a single drop of blood
has been shed by the Provisional Government which has erected
no barrier against the free expression of public opinion....&rdquo;
This non-resistance to evil at the moment when a fierce struggle,
unfettered by moral or patriotic considerations, was being
conducted by some groups of the population for motives of self-preservation
and by others for the attainment by violence of
extreme demands, was undoubtedly a confession of impotence.
In the subsequent declarations of the second and third Coalition
Governments mention was made &ldquo;of stringent measures&rdquo; against
the forces of disorganisation in the country. These words,
however, were never translated into deeds.</p>

<p>The idea of not forestalling the will of the Constituent Assembly
was not carried out by the Government, especially in the domain
of national self-determination. The Government proclaimed the
independence of Poland, but made &ldquo;the consent to such alterations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
of the territory of the Russian State as may be necessary for the
creation of independent Poland&rdquo; dependent upon the All-Russian
Constituent Assembly. That proclamation, the legal validity of
which is contestable, was, however, in full accord with the juridical
standpoint of society. With regard to Finland, the Government
did not alter her legal status towards Russia, but confirmed the
rights and privileges of the country, cancelled all the limitations
of the Finnish Constitution and intended to convoke the Finnish
Chamber (&ldquo;Seim&rdquo;) that was to confirm the new constitution of
the Principality. The Government subsequently adhered to their
intention to entertain favourably all the just demands of the Finns
for local reconstruction. Nevertheless, both the Provisional
Government and Finland were engaged in a protracted struggle
for power on account of the universal desire for the immediate
satisfaction of the interests of the separate nationalities. On
July 6th the Finnish Assembly passed a law (by the majority of
Social-Democratic votes) proclaiming the assumption by that body
of supreme power after the abdication &ldquo;of the Finnish Grand-Duke&rdquo;
(the official title of the Russian Emperor). Only foreign
affairs, military legislation and administration were left to the
Provisional Government. This decision corresponded to a certain
degree with the resolution of the Congress of Soviets, which
demanded that full independence should be granted to Finland
before the convocation of the Constituent Assembly, with the
above-mentioned restrictions. The Russian Government answered
this declaration of the actual independence of Finland by dissolving
the Assembly, which met, however, once again in September of
its own free will. In this struggle, the intensity of which varied
according to the rise and fall of the political barometer in Petrograd,
the Finnish politicians, disregarding the interests of the
State and having no support whatsoever in the Army, counted
exclusively upon the loyalty or, to be more correct, the weakness
of the Provisional Government. Matters never reached the stage
of open rebellion. The conscious elements of the population kept
the country within the limits of reasonableness, not out of loyalty,
but perhaps because they feared the consequences of civil war and
especially of the sabotage in which the licentious soldiers and
sailors would have presumably indulged.</p>

<p>May and June were spent in a struggle for power between the
Government and the self-appointed Central Rada (Assembly).
The All-Ukrainian Military Congress, also convened arbitrarily on
June 8th, demanded that the Government should immediately
comply with all the demands of the Central Rada and the Congresses,
and suggested that the Rada should cease to address the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
Government, but should begin at once to organise the autonomous
administration of the Ukraine. On June 11th the autonomous
Constitution of the Ukraine was adopted and a Secretariat (Council
of Ministers) formed under the chairmanship of Mr. Vinnichenko.
After the Government envoys&mdash;the Ministers Kerensky, Tereschenko
and Tzeretelli&mdash;had negotiated with the Rada, a proclamation
was issued on July 2nd, which forestalled the decision of
the Constituent Assembly and proclaimed the autonomy of the
Ukraine with certain restrictions. The Central Rada and the
Secretariat were gradually seizing the administration, creating a
dual power on the spot and discrediting the All-Russian Government.
They thus provoked civil strife and provided moral excuses
for every endeavor to shirk civic and military duties to the
common Mother Country. The Central Rada, moreover, contained
from the outset sympathisers with Germany and was undoubtedly
connected through the &ldquo;Union for the Liberation of the Ukraine&rdquo;
with the headquarters of the Central Powers. Bearing in mind
the ample material collected by the Stavka, Vinnichenko&rsquo;s half-hearted
confession to a French correspondent (?) with regard to
Germanophil tendencies in the Rada, and finally the report of the
Procurator of the Kiev Court of Appeal at the end of August,
1917, I cannot doubt that the Rada played a criminal part. The
Procurator complained that the complete destruction of the
machinery of intelligence and of criminal investigation deprived
the Government prosecutors of the possibility of investigating
the situation; he said that not only German espionage and propaganda,
but the mutinies of the Ukrainian troops, as well as the
destination of obscure funds of undoubted Austro-German origin
... could be traced to the Rada.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Ministry of the Interior, which, in the old days, practically
controlled the Autocracy and provoked universal hatred, now went
to the other extreme. It all but abolished itself, and the functions
of that branch of the administration were divided among local,
self-appointed organisations. The history of the organs of the
Ministry of the Interior is, in many ways, similar to the fate of
the Supreme Command. On March 5th the Minister-President
issued an order for the suppression of the offices of Governor and
of Inspector of Police (&ldquo;Ispravnik&rdquo;), which were to be replaced
by the presidents of the Provincial and District self-governing
Councils (&ldquo;Oupravas&rdquo;), and for the police to be replaced by a
militia organised by Social Institutions. This measure, adopted
owing to the universal dislike for the agents of the old rÃ©gime,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
was, in fact, the only actual manifestation of the Government&rsquo;s
will; because the status of the Commissars was not established
by law until the month of September. The instructions and orders
of the Government were, on the whole, of an academic nature,
because life followed its own course, and was regulated, or, to be
more correct, muddled up, by local revolutionary changes of the
law. The office of Government Commissars became a sinecure
from the very outset. They had no power or authority, and
became entirely dependent upon revolutionary organisations.
When the latter passed a vote of censure upon the activities of
a Commissar, he could practically do nothing more. The organisations
elected a new one, and his confirmation in office by the
Provisional Government was a mere formality. In the first six
weeks seventeen Provincial Commissars and a great many District
Commissars were thus removed. Later, in July, Tzeretelli, during
his tenure of the office of Minister of the Interior, which lasted
for a fortnight, gave official sanction to this procedure and sent a
circular to the Local Soviets and Committees, inviting them to
send in to him the names of desirable candidates, which were to
replace the unsuitable ones. Thus there remained no representatives
of the Central power on the spot. In the beginning of the
Revolution the so-called &ldquo;Social Committees&rdquo; or &ldquo;Soviets of
Social Organisation&rdquo; really represented a social Institution comprising
the union of towns and <i>Zemstvos</i>, of Municipal Dumas,
professional Unions, Co-operatives, Magistrates, etc. Things
went from bad to worse when these Social Committees were
dissolved into class and party organisations. Local power passed
into the hands of the Soviets of Workmen and Soldiers and in
places before the law had been produced to &ldquo;democratised&rdquo;
Socialistic Dumas, closely reminiscent of semi-Bolshevik Soviets.</p>

<p>The regulations issued by the Government on April 15th, on
the organisation of Municipal Self-Government, comprised the
following main points:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(1) All citizens of both sexes, having attained the age of
twenty, were given the suffrage in the town.</p>

<p>(2) No domiciliary qualification was established.</p>

<p>(3) A proportional system of elections was introduced.</p>

<p>(4) The Military were given the suffrage in the localities in
which the respective garrisons were quartered.</p></blockquote>

<p>I will not examine in detail these regulations, which are probably
the most Democratic ever known in Municipal Law, because
the experience gained in their application was too short to afford
any ground for discussion. I will only note one phenomenon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
which accompanied the introduction of these regulations in the
autumn of 1917. The free vote in many places became a mockery.
Throughout the length and breadth of Russia, all the non-Socialist
and politically neutral parties were under suspicion and were
subjected to persecution. They were not allowed to conduct
propaganda, and their meetings were dispersed. Electioneering
was characterised by blatant abuses. Occasionally election agents
were subjected to violence and lists of candidates destroyed. At
the same time the licentious and demoralised soldiery of many
garrisons&mdash;chance guests in the town in which, as often as not,
they had only appeared a day or two before&mdash;rushed to the polls
and presented lists drawn up by the extreme Anti-National parties.
There were cases when military units, arriving after the elections,
demanded a re-election and accompanied this demand by threats and
sometimes murders. There can be no doubt that, among the circumstances
that affected the August elections in Petrograd to the Municipal
Duma, to which sixty-seven Bolsheviks out of two hundred
were elected, the presence in the Capital of numerous demoralised
garrisons was not the least important. The authorities were silent
because they were absent. The <i>Petite Bourgeoisie</i>, the intellectual
workers, in a word, the Town Democracy in the widest sense, was
the weakest party and was always defeated in that Revolutionary
struggle. The mutinies, rebellions, and separations of various
Republics&mdash;the precursors of the bloody Soviet RÃ©gime&mdash;had the
most painful effect on the life of that portion of the community.
The &ldquo;self-determination&rdquo; of the soldiers caused uneasiness and
even fear of unrestricted violence. Even travelling was unsafe and
difficult, because the railways fell into the hands of deserters. The
&ldquo;self-determination&rdquo; of the workmen resulted in the impossibility
of obtaining supplies of the most necessary commodities, owing
to a tremendous rise in prices. The &ldquo;self-determination&rdquo; of the
villages produced a stoppage of supplies, and the villages were
thus left to starve; not to mention the moral ordeal of the class
which was subjected to insults and degradation. The Revolution
had raised hopes for the betterment of the conditions of life for
everyone except the <i>Bourgeois</i> Democracy, because even the
moral conquests proclaimed by the new Revolutionary power&mdash;liberty
of speech, of the Press and of meetings, etc.&mdash;soon
belonged exclusively to the Revolutionary Democracy. The
upper <i>Bourgeoisie</i> (intellectually superior) was organised to a
certain extent by means of the Constitutional Democratic Party,
but the <i>Petite Bourgeoisie</i> (the <i>Bourgeois</i> Democracy) had no
organisation whatsoever and no means for an organised struggle.
The Democratic Municipalities were losing their true Democratic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
aspect&mdash;not as a result of the new Municipal law, but of
Revolutionary practice&mdash;and became mere class organs of the
Proletariat, or the representatives of purely Socialistic parties,
completely out of touch with the people.</p>

<p>Self-government in the districts and in the villages in the first
period of the Revolution was of more or less the same nature.
Towards the autumn there should have been a Democratic system
of <i>Zemstvo</i> Administration, on the same basis as that in the municipalities.
The District (Volost) <i>Zemstvo</i> was to undertake the
administration of local agriculture, education, order and safety.
As a matter of fact, the villages were administered&mdash;if such a word
can be applied to Anarchy&mdash;by a complex agglomeration of
revolutionary organisations, such as peasant Congresses, Supply
and Land Committees, Popular Soviets, Village Councils, etc.
Very often another peculiar organisation&mdash;that of the deserters&mdash;dominated
them all. At any rate, the All-Russian Union of
Peasants agreed with the following declaration made by the left
wing: &ldquo;All our work for the organisation of various Committees
will be of no avail if these Social Organisations are to remain
under the constant threat of being terrorised by accidental armed
bands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The only question that deeply perturbed the minds of the
peasantry and overshadowed all other events, was the old, painful,
traditional question:</p>

<p>THE QUESTION OF THE LAND.</p>

<p>It was an exceptionally complex and tangled question. It
arose more than once in the shape of fruitless mutinies, which
were ruthlessly suppressed. The wave of agrarian troubles which
swept over Russia in the years of the First Revolution (1905-6)
and left a trail of fire and ruined estates was an indication of the
consequences that were bound to follow the Revolution of 1917.
It is difficult to form an exhaustive idea of the motives which
prompted the land-owners to defend their rights so stubbornly and
so energetically: was it atavism, a natural yearning for the land,
statesmanlike considerations as to the desirability of increasing
the productivity of the land by introducing higher methods of
agriculture, a desire to maintain a direct influence over the people,
or was it merely selfishness?... One thing is certain&mdash;the
agrarian reforms were overdue. Retribution could not fail to
overtake the Government and the Ruling Classes for the long
years of poverty, oppression, and, what is most important, the
incredible moral and intellectual darkness in which the peasant
masses were kept, their education being entirely neglected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p>The peasants demanded that all land should be surrendered to
them, and would not wait for the decision of the Central Land
Committee or of the Constituent Assembly. This impatience
was undoubtedly due, to a great extent, to the weakness of the
Government and to outside influences, which will be described
later. There was no divergence of opinion as to the fundamental
idea of the reforms. The Liberal Democracy and the <i>Bourgeoisie</i>,
the Revolutionary Democracy and the Provisional Government,
all spoke quite definitely about &ldquo;handing the land over to the
workers.&rdquo; With the same unanimity these elements favoured
the idea of leaving the final decision on the reform of the land
and legislation on the subject to the Constituent Assembly. This
irreconcilable divergence of opinion arose by reason of the very
essence of land reform. Liberal circles in Russia stood for the
private ownership of the land&mdash;an idea which found increasing
favour with the peasants&mdash;and demanded that the peasants should
receive allotments rather than that the land should be entirely
redistributed. On the other hand, the Revolutionary Democracy
advocated, at all meetings of every party, class and profession,
the adoption of the Resolution of the All-Russian Congress of
Peasants, which was passed on May 25th, with the approval of
the Minister Tchernov on &ldquo;the transfer of all lands ... <i>to the
people as a whole, as their patrimony, on the basis of equal possession
without any payment</i>.&rdquo; The peasants did not or would
not understand this Social Revolutionary Resolution, which caused
dissensions. The peasants were private owners by nature and
could not understand the principle of nationalisation. The principle
of equal possession meant that many millions of peasants, whose
allotments were larger than the normal, would lose their surplus
allotments, and the whole question of the redistribution of the
land would lead to endless civil war; because there were innumerable
peasants who had no land at all, and only 45,000,000 dessiatines
of arable land which did not belong to the peasants to
divide among 20,000,000 peasant households.</p>

<p>The Provisional Government did not consider itself entitled
to solve the land problem. Under the pressure of the masses, it
transferred its rights partly to the Ministry of Agriculture, partly
to the Central Land Committee, which was organised on the basis
of broad, democratic representation. The latter was entrusted
with the task of collecting data and of drawing up a scheme of
land reform, as well as of regulating the existing conditions with
regard to the land. In practice, the use of the land transfer, rent,
employment of labour, etc., were dealt with by the Local Land
Committees. These bodies contained illiterate elements&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
intellectuals as a rule were excluded&mdash;which had selfish motives
and had no perception either of the extent or of the limits of their
powers. The Central Representative Institutions and the Ministry
of Agriculture, under Tchernov, issued appeals against arbitrariness
and for the preservation of the land, pending the decision of
the Constituent Assembly. At the same time they overtly encouraged
&ldquo;temporary possession of the land,&rdquo; as seizure of the
land was then described, on the excuse that the Government were
obliged to sell as much land as possible. The propaganda that
was conducted on a large scale in the villages by irresponsible
representatives of Socialist and Anarchist circles completed
Tchernov&rsquo;s work.</p>

<p>The results of this policy were soon apparent. In one of his
circulars to Provincial Commissars, the Minister of the Interior,
Tzeretelli, admitted that complete anarchy reigned in the villages:
&ldquo;Land is being seized and sold, agricultural labourers are forced
to stop working, and landowners are faced with demands which
are economically impossible. Breeding stock is being destroyed
and implements plundered. Model farms are being ruined.
Forests are being cut down irrespective of ownership, timber and
logs are being stolen, and their shipment prevented. No sowing
is done on privately-owned farms, and harvests of grain and hay
are not reaped.&rdquo; The Minister accused the Local Committees and
the Peasant Congresses of organising arbitrary seizures of the
land, and came to the conclusion that the existing conditions of
agriculture and forestry &ldquo;would inevitably bring about endless
calamities for the Army and the country, and threatened the very
existence of the State.&rdquo; If we recall the fires, the murders, the
lynchings, the destruction of estates, which were often filled with
treasures of great historical and artistic value, we shall have a true
picture of the life of the villages in those days.</p>

<p>The question of the ownership of the land by the landlords was
thus not merely a matter of selfish class interest, all the more
as, not only the landlords but the wealthy peasants were subjected
to violence by order of the Committees, and in spite of them. One
village rose against another. It was not a question of the transfer
of riches from one class or individual to another, but of the
destruction of treasures, of agriculture, and of the economic
stability of the State. The instincts of proprietorship inherent in
the peasantry irresistibly grew as these seizures and partitions
took place. The mental attitude of the peasantry upset all the
plans of the Revolutionary Democracy. By converting the
peasants into a <i>Petite Bourgeoisie</i>, it threatened to postpone to
an indefinite date the triumph of Socialism. The villagers were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
obsessed by the idea of land distribution and by their own interests,
and were not in the least concerned with the War, with politics,
or with social questions which did not directly affect them. The
workers of the village were being killed and maimed at the front,
and the village, therefore, considered the War as a burden. The
authorities disallowed seizures of the land and imposed restrictions
in the shape of monopolies and fixed prices for corn. The
peasantry, therefore, bore a grudge against the Government.
The towns ceased to supply manufactured goods and the villages
were estranged from the towns and ceased to supply them with
grain. This was the only real &ldquo;conquest&rdquo; made by the Revolution,
and those who profited by it grew very anxious as to the
attitude of future Governments towards the arbitrary solution of
the land question. They therefore actively encouraged anarchy
in the villages, condoned seizures and undermined the authority
of the Provisional Government. By this means they hoped to
bring the peasants over to their side as supporters, or, at least, as
a neutral element, in the impending decisive struggle for power.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The abolition of the police by the order issued on April 17th
was one of the acts of the Government which seriously complicated
the normal course of life. In reality, this act only confirmed the
conditions which had arisen almost everywhere in the first days
of the Revolution, and were directly due to the wrath of the people
against the Executive of the old regime, and especially of those
who had been oppressed and persecuted by the police and had
suddenly found themselves on the crest of the wave. It would be
a hopeless task to defend the Russian police as an institution. It
could only be considered good by comparing it with the militia and
with the Extraordinary Bolshevik Commission....</p>

<p>In any case it would have been useless to resist the abolition
of the police, because it was a psychological necessity. There can
be no doubt that the attitude and actions of the old police were
due less to their political opinions than to the instructions of their
employers and to their own personal interests. No wonder, therefore,
that the gendarmes and the policemen, insulted and
persecuted, introduced a very bad element into the Army, into
which they were subsequently forcibly drafted. The Revolutionary
Democracy, in self defence, grossly exaggerated their counter-revolutionary
activities in the Army; nevertheless, it is absolutely
true that a great many ex-officers of the police and of the gendarmerie,
partly, perhaps, from motives of self-defence, chose for
themselves a most lucrative profession&mdash;that of the demagogue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
and the agitator. The fact is that the abolition of the police in
the very midst of the turmoil&mdash;when crime was on the increase
and the guarantees of public safety and of the safety of individual
property were weakened&mdash;was a real calamity. The militia, indeed,
far from being a substitute for the police, was a caricature
of them. In Western countries the police is placed as a united
force under the orders of a Department of the Central Government.
The Provisional Government placed the militia under the
orders of <i>Zemstvo</i> and Municipal Administrations. The Government
Commissars were only entitled to make use of the militia
for certain definite purposes. The cadres of the militia were filled
by untrained men, devoid of technical experience, and, as often
as not, criminals. By virtue of the new law, there were admitted
to the militia persons under arrest or who had served a term
of imprisonment for comparatively grave offences. The system of
recruiting practised by some forcibly &ldquo;democratised&rdquo; <i>Zemstvo</i>
and Municipal institutions tended quite as much as the new law
towards the deterioration of the personnel of the militia.</p>

<p>The Chief of the Central Administration of the Militia himself
admitted that escaped convicts were sometimes placed in command
of the militia. The villages were sometimes without any militia at
all, and they administered themselves as best they could.</p>

<p>In its proclamation of April 25th the Provisional Government
gave an accurate description of the condition of the country in
stating that &ldquo;the growth of new social ties was slower than the
process of disruption caused by the collapse of the old rÃ©gime.&rdquo;

<p class="chapsummary"><span class="smcap">The Activities of the Provisional Government: Food
Supplies, Industry, Transport and Finance.</span></p>

<p>In the early spring of 1917 the deficiency in supplies for the
Army and for the towns was rapidly growing. In one of its
appeals to the peasants the Soviet said: &ldquo;The enemies of freedom,
the supporters of the deposed Czar, are taking advantage of the
shortage of food in the towns <i>for which they are themselves
responsible</i> in order to undermine your freedom and ours. They
say that the Revolution has left the country without bread....&rdquo;
This simple explanation, adduced by the Revolutionary Democracy
in every crisis, was, of course, one-sided. There was the
inheritance of the old rÃ©gime as well as the inevitable consequences
of three years of war, during which imports of agricultural
implements had come to a standstill, labourers were taken from
the land, and, as a result, the area under crops was diminished.
But these were not the only reasons for the food shortage in a
fertile country&mdash;a shortage which in the autumn was considered
by the Government as disastrous. The food policy of the
Government and the fluctuation of prices, the depreciation of the
currency and a rise in the price of commodities entirely out of
proportion to the fixed prices for grain also largely contributed
to this result. This rise in prices was due to general economic
conditions, and especially to a very rapid rise in wages; to the
agrarian policy of the Government, the inadequacy of the area
under crops, to the turmoil in the villages, and to the breakdown
of transport. Private trade was abolished and the entire matter
of food supplies was handed over to Food Supply Committees&mdash;undoubtedly
democratic in character, but, with the exception of
the representatives of the Co-operatives, inexperienced and devoid
of a creative spirit. There are many more reasons, great and
small, which may be included in the formula: The Old RÃ©gime,
the War and the Revolution.</p>

<p>On March 29th the Provisional Government introduced the
grain monopoly. The entire surplus of grain, excluding normal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
supplies, seed corn and fodder, reverted to the State. At the same
time the Government once again raised the fixed price of grain,
and promised to introduce fixed prices for all necessary commodities,
such as iron, textiles, leather, kerosine oil, etc. This
last measure, which was universally recognised as just, and to
which the Minister of Supplies attributed a very great
importance, proved impossible of application owing to the confused
condition of the country. Russia was covered by a huge
network of Food Supply Institutions, which cost 500,000,000
roubles a year, but could not cope with their work. The villages,
on the other hand, had ceased to pay taxes and rents, were
flooded with paper money, for which they could get no equivalent
in manufactured goods, and were by no means anxious to supply
grain. Propaganda and appeals were of no avail, and, as often
as not, force had to be applied.</p>

<p>In its Proclamation of August 29th the Government admitted
that the Country was in a desperate position; the Government
stores were emptying; towns, provinces, and armies at the Front
were in dire need of bread, <i>although, in fact, there was sufficient
bread in the country</i>. Some had not delivered last year&rsquo;s harvest;
some were agitating and preventing others from doing their duty.
In order to avert grave danger, the Government once more raised
the fixed prices and threatened to apply stringent measures against
the offenders, and to regulate prices and the distribution of articles
required by the villages. But the vicious circle of conflicting
political, social and class interests was narrowing, like to a tight
noose, round the neck of the Government, paralysing its will-power
and energy.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The condition of industry was no less acute, and it was
steadily falling into ruin. Here, as in the matter of supplies,
the calamity cannot be ascribed to one set of causes, as happened
when the employers and the workmen levelled accusations against
one another. The former were charged with taking excessive
profits and having recourse to sabotage in order to upset the
Revolution, while the latter were blamed for slackness and greed
and for deriving selfish gains from the Revolution. The causes
may be divided into three categories.</p>

<p>Owing to various political and economic reasons and to the
fact that the old Government did not devote sufficient attention
to the development of the natural resources of the country, our
industries were not placed on a solid basis, and were to a great
extent dependent upon foreign markets even for such material<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
as might easily have been found in Russia. Thus in 1912 there
was a serious shortage of pig-iron, and in 1913 of fuel. From
1908 to 1913 imports of metals from abroad rose from 29 to 34 per
cent. Before the War we imported 48 per cent. of cotton. We
needed 2,750,000 pouds<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> of wool from abroad out of a total of
the 5,000,000 pouds produced.</p>

<p>The War unquestionably affected industry very deeply.
Normal imports came to a standstill. The mines of Dombrovsk
were lost. Owing to strategical requirements, transport was
weakened, supplies of fuel and of raw materials diminished. Most
of the factories had to work for the Army, and their personnel
was curtailed by mobilisations. From an economic point of view,
the militarisation of industry was a heavy burden for the population,
because, according to the estimates made by one of the
Ministers, the Army absorbed 40 to 50 per cent. of the total of
goods produced by the country. Finally, the War widened the
gulf between the employers and the workmen, as the former made
immense profits, whereas the latter were impoverished, and their
condition was further aggravated by the suspension of certain
professional guarantees on account of the War by the fact that
certain categories of workmen were drafted by conscription to
definite industrial concerns, and by the general burden of inflated
prices and inadequate food supplies.</p>

<p>Even in these abnormal circumstances Russian industries to
some extent fulfilled the requirements of the moment, but the
Revolution dealt them a death blow, which caused their gradual
dislocation and ultimate collapse. On the one hand, the
Provisional Government was legislating for the establishment of
a strict Government control of the industries of the country and
for regulating them by heavily taxing profits and excess war
profits, as well as by Government distribution of fuel, raw
materials and food. The latter measure caused the trading class
to be practically eliminated and to be replaced by democratic
organisations. Whether excess profits disappeared as a result of
this policy, or were merely transferred to another class, it is not
easy to decide. On the other hand, the Government were deeply
concerned with the protection of labour, and were drafting and
passing various laws concerning the freedom of unions, labour
exchanges, conciliation boards, social insurance, etc. Unfortunately,
the impatience and the desire for &ldquo;law-making&rdquo; which
had seized the villages were also apparent in the factories. Heads
of industrial concerns were dismissed wholesale, as well as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
administrative and technical staffs. These dismissals were accompanied
by insults and sometimes by violence, out of revenge for
past offences, real or imaginary. Some of the members of the
staffs resigned of their own accord, because they were unable to
endure the humiliating position into which they were forced by
the workmen. Given our low level of technical and educational
standards, such methods were fraught with grave danger. As in
the Army, so in the factories, Committees replaced by elections
the dismissed personnel with utterly untrained and ignorant men.
Sometimes the workmen completely seized the industrial concerns.
Ignorant and unprovided with capital, they led these concerns to
ruin, and were themselves driven to unemployment and misery.
Labour discipline in the factories completely vanished, and no
means was left of exercising moral, material or judicial pressure
or compulsion. The &ldquo;consciousness&rdquo; alone of the workers
proved inadequate. The technical and administrative personnel
which remained or was newly elected could no longer direct the
industries and enjoyed no authority, as it was thoroughly
terrorised by the workmen. Naturally, therefore, the working
hours were still further curtailed, work became careless, and
production fell to its lowest ebb. The metallurgical industries of
Moscow fell 32 per cent. and the productivity of the Petrograd
factories 20 to 40 per cent. as early as in the month of April.
In June the production of coal and the general production of the
Donetz basin fell 30 per cent. The production of oil in Baku
and Grozni also suffered. The greatest injury, however, was
inflicted upon the industries by the monstrous demands for higher
wages, completely out of proportion to the cost of living and
to the productivity of labour, as well as to the actual paying
capacity of the industries. These demands greatly exceeded all
excess profits. The following figures are quoted in a Report to
the Provisional Government: In eighteen concerns in the Donetz
Basin, with a total profit of 75,000,000 roubles per annum, the
workmen demanded a wage increase of 240,000,000 roubles per
annum; the total amount of increased wages in all the mining
and metallurgical factories of the South was 800,000,000 roubles
per annum. In the Urals the total Budget was 200,000,000, while
the wages rose to 300,000,000. In the Putilov factory alone, in
Petrograd, before the end of 1917, the increase in wages amounted
to 90,000,000 roubles. The wages rose from 200 to 300 per cent.
The increase in the wages of the textile workers of Moscow rose
500 per cent., as compared to 1914. The burden of these increases
naturally fell on the Government, as most of the factories were
working for the defence of the country. Owing to the condition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
of industry described above, and to the psychology of the workmen,
industrial concerns collapsed, and the country experienced
an acute shortage of necessary commodities, with a corresponding
increase in prices. Hence the rise in the price of bread and
the reluctance of the villages to supply the towns.</p>

<p>At the same time Bolshevism introduced a permanent ferment
into the labouring masses. It flattered the lowest instincts, fanned
hatred against the wealthy classes, encouraged excessive demands,
and paralysed every endeavour of the Government and of the
moderate Democratic organisations to arrest the disruption of
industry: &ldquo;All for the Proletariat and through the Proletariat....&rdquo;
Bolshevism held up to the working class vivid
and entrancing vistas of political domination and economic prosperity,
through the destruction of the Capitalist rÃ©gime and the
transfer to the workmen of political power, of industries, of the
means of production, and of the wealth of the country. And all
this was to come at once, immediately, and not as a result of a
lengthy, social, economic process and organised struggle. The
imagination of the masses, unfettered by knowledge or by the
authority of leading professional unions, which were morally
undermined by the Bolsheviks, and were on the verge of collapse,
was fired by visions of avenging the hardships and boredom of
heavy toil in the past, and of enjoying amenities of a <i>Bourgeois</i>
existence, which they despised and yet yearned for with equal
ardour. It was &ldquo;Now or Never: All or Nothing!&rdquo; As
life was destroying illusions, and the implacable law of economics
was meting out the punishment of high prices, hunger and unemployment,
Bolshevism was the more convincingly insisting upon
the necessity of rebellion and explaining the causes of the calamity
and the means of averting it. The causes were: the policy of the
Provisional Government, which was trying to reintroduce
enslavement by the Bourgeoisie, the sabotage of the employers,
and the connivance of the Revolutionary Democracy, including
the Mensheviks, which had sold itself to the Bourgeoisie. The
means was the transfer of power to the Proletariat.</p>

<p>All these circumstances were gradually killing Russian
Industry.</p>

<p>In spite of all these disturbances, the dislocation of industry
was not immediately felt in the Army to an appreciable degree,
because attention was concentrated upon the Army at the expense
of the vital necessities of the country itself, and also because for
several months there had been a lull at the Front. In June,
1917, therefore, we were provided adequately, if not amply, for
an important offensive. Imports of war material through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
Archangel, Murmansk, and partly through Vladivostok had
increased, but had not been sufficiently developed by reason of
the natural shortcomings of maritime routes, and of the low carrying
capacity of the Siberian and of the Murmansk Railways.
Only 16 per cent. of the actual needs of the Army were satisfied.
The military administration, however, clearly saw that we were
living on the old stores collected by the patriotic impulse and effort
of the country in 1916. By August, 1917, the most important
factories for the production of war materials had suffered a check.
The production of guns and of shells had fallen 60 per cent.,
and of aircraft 80 per cent. The possibility of continuing the
War under worse material conditions was, however, amply proved
later by the Soviet Government, which had been using the supplies
available in 1917 and the remnants of Russian Industrial production
for the conduct of civil war for more than three years. This,
of course, was only possible through such an unexampled curtailment
of the consuming market that we are practically driven back
to primitive conditions of life.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Transport was likewise in a state of dislocation. As early as
May, 1917, at the Regular Congress of Railway Representatives
at the Stavka, the opinion was expressed, and confirmed by many
specialists, that, unless the general conditions of the country
changed, our railways would come to a standstill within six
months. Practice has disproved theory. For over three years,
under the impossible conditions of Civil War and of the Bolshevik
RÃ©gime, the railways have continued to work. It is true that they
did not satisfy the needs of the population even in a small
measure, but they served the strategical purposes. That this
situation cannot last, and that the entire network of the Russian
Railways is approaching its doom, is hardly open to doubt. In
the history of the disintegration of the Russian Railway System
the same conditions are traceable which I have mentioned in
regard to the Army, the villages, and especially the industries:
the inheritance of the unwise policy of the past in regard to railways,
the excessive demands of the War, the wear and tear of
rolling stock, and anarchy on the line, due to the behaviour of
a licentious soldiery; the general economic condition of the
country, the shortage of rails, of metal and of fuel; the &ldquo;democratisation&rdquo;
of Railway Administration, in which the power was
seized by various Committees; the disorganisation of the administrative
and technical personnel, which was subjected to persecu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>tion;
the low producing power of labour and the steady growth of
the economic demands of the railway employees and workmen.</p>

<p>In other branches of the Administration the Government
offered a certain resistance to the systematic seizure of power by
private organisations, but in the Ministry of Railways that pernicious
system was introduced by the Government itself, in the
person of the Minister Nekrassov. He was the friend and the
inspirer of Kerensky, alternately Minister of Railways and of
Finance, Assistant and Vice-President of the Council of Ministers,
Governor-General of Finland, Octobrist, Cadet (Constitutional
Democrat), and Radical Democrat, holding the scales between
the Government and the Soviet. Nekrassov was the darkest and
the most fatal figure in the Governing Circles, and left the stamp
of destruction upon everything he touched&mdash;the All-Russian Executive
Committee of the Union of Railways, the autonomy of the
Ukraine, or the Kornilov movement.</p>

<p>The Ministry had no economic or technical plan. As a matter
of fact, no such plan could ever be carried out, because Nekrassov
decided to introduce into the Railway Organisation, hitherto
strongly disciplined, &ldquo;the new principles of Democratic Organisation,
instead of the old watchwords of compulsion and fear&rdquo;(?).
Soviets and Committees were implanted upon every branch of the
Railway Administration. Enormous sums were spent upon this
undertaking, and, by his famous circular of May 27th, the Minister
assigned to these organisations a very wide scope of control and
management, as well as of the &ldquo;direction&rdquo; which they were
henceforward entitled to give to the responsible personnel in the
Administration. Executive functions were subsequently promised
to these organisations.... &ldquo;Meanwhile the Ministry of
Railways and its subordinate branches will work in strict accordance
with the ideas and wishes of the United Railway Workers.&rdquo;
Nekrassov thus handed over to a private organisation the most
important interests of the State&mdash;the direction of the Railway
policy, the control of the Defence, of industries, and of all other
branches dependent upon the railway system. As one of our contemporary
critics has said, this measure would have been entirely
justified had the whole population of Russia consisted of railway
employees. This reform, carried out by Nekrassov on a scale
unprecedented in history, was something worse than a mere
blunder. The general trend of Ministerial policy was well understood.
In the beginning of August, at the Moscow Congress,
which was turned into a weapon for the Socialist parties of the
Left, one of the leaders declared that &ldquo;the Railway Union must
be fully autonomous and no authority except that of the workers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
themselves should be entitled to interfere with it.&rdquo; In other
words, a State within a State.</p>

<p>Disruption ensued. A new phase of the arbitrariness of ever-changing
organisations was introduced into the strict and precise
mechanism of the railway services in the centre as well as throughout
the country. I understand the democratisation that opens to
the popular masses wide access to science, technical knowledge,
and art, but I do not understand the democratisation of these
achievements of human intellect.</p>

<p>There followed anarchy and the collapse of Labour discipline.
As early as in July the position of the railways was rendered
hopeless through the action of the Government.</p>

<p>After holding the office of Minister of Railways for four
months, Nekrassov went to the Ministry of Finance, of
which he was utterly ignorant, and his successor, Yurenev,
began to struggle against the usurpation of power by the
railwaymen, as he considered &ldquo;the interference of private
persons and organisations with the executive functions of the
Department as a crime against the State.&rdquo; The struggle was
conducted by the customary methods of the Provisional Government,
and what was lost could no longer be recovered. At the
Moscow Congress the President of the Union of the Railwaymen,
fully conscious of its power, said that the struggle against democratic
organisations was a manifestation of counter-Revolution,
that the Union would use every weapon in order to counteract
these endeavours, and &ldquo;would be strong enough to slay this
counter-Revolutionary hydra.&rdquo; As is well known, the All-Russian
Executive Committee of the Union of Railways subsequently
became a political organisation pure and simple, and betrayed
Kornilov to Kerensky and Kerensky to Lenin. With a zeal
worthy of the secret police of the old rÃ©gime, it hunted out
Kornilov&rsquo;s followers, and finally met an inglorious end in the
clutches of Bolshevik Centralisation.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We now come to another element in the life of the State&mdash;Finance.
Every normal financial system is dependent upon a series
of conditions: general political conditions, offering a guarantee
of the external and internal stability of the State and of the
country; strategical conditions, defining the measure of efficiency
of the National Defence; economic conditions, such as the productivity
of the country&rsquo;s industries and the relation of production to
consumption; the conditions of labour, of transport, etc. The
Government, the Front, the villages, the factories, and the trans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>port
offered no necessary guarantees, and the Ministry of Finance
could but have recourse to palliatives in order to arrest the disruption
of the entire system of the currency and the complete
collapse of the Budget, pending the restoration of comparative
order in the country. According to the accepted view, the main
defects of our pre-War Budget were that it was based upon the
revenue of the spirit monopoly (800,000,000 roubles), and that
there was scarcely any direct taxation. Before the War the
Budget of Russia was about 3&frac12; milliards of roubles; the National
Debt was about 8&frac12; milliards, and we paid nearly 400,000,000
roubles interest per annum; half of that sum went abroad, and
was partially covered by 1&frac12; milliards of our exports. The War
and Prohibition completely upset our Budget. Government
expenses during the War reached the following figures:</p>

<table summary="Government expenses">
<tr><td class="tdr padr">&frac12; 1914</td>

</table>

<p>The enormous deficit was partially covered by loans and by
paper currency. The expenses of the War were met, however,
out of the so-called &ldquo;War Fund.&rdquo; At the Stavka, in accordance
with the dictates of practical wisdom, expenditure was under the
full control of the Chief-of-Staff of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief,
who determined the heads of expenditure in his Orders,
schedules, and estimates.</p>

<p>The Revolution dealt the death-blow to our finance. As
Shingarev, the Minister of Finance, said, the Revolution
&ldquo;induced everyone to claim more rights, and stifled any sense of
duty. Everybody demanded higher wages, but no one dreamt of
paying taxes, and the finances of the country were thus placed
in a hopeless position.&rdquo; There was a real orgy; everyone was
desperately trying to grab as much as possible from the Treasury
under the guise of democratisation, taking advantage of the
impotence of the Government and of powerlessness to resist.
Even Nekrassov had the courage to declare at the Moscow Congress
that &ldquo;Never in history had any Czarist Government been
as generous and prodigal as the Government of Revolutionary
Russia,&rdquo; and that &ldquo;the new Revolutionary rÃ©gime is much more
expensive than the old one.&rdquo; Suffice it to quote a few &ldquo;astronomic&rdquo;
figures in order to gauge the insuperable obstacles in
the way of a reasonable Budget. The decline of production and
the excessive rise in wages resulted in the necessity of enormous
expenditure for subsidies to expiring concerns and for over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>payments
for means of production. These over-payments in the
Donetz Basin alone amounted to 1,200,000,000 roubles; the
increase in the soldiers&rsquo; pay, 500,000,000 roubles; railwaymen&rsquo;s
pay, 350,000,000 roubles; Post Office employees, 60,000,000
roubles. After a month the latter demanded another 105,000,000
roubles, while the entire revenue of the Posts and Telegraphs
was 60,000,000 roubles. The Soviet demanded 11 milliards (in
other words, nearly the total of the Budget for 1915) for allowances
to soldiers&rsquo; wives, whereas only 2 milliards had been spent
till 1917 under this head. The Food Supply Committees cost
500,000,000 roubles per annum, and the Land Committee
140,000,000 roubles, etc., etc. Meanwhile the revenue was falling
steadily. Thus, for example, the Land Tax fell 32 per cent. in the
first few months of the Revolution; the revenue from town property,
41 per cent.; the House Tax, 43 per cent., etc. At the same
time, our internal troubles caused the depreciation of the rouble
and a fall in the price of Russian securities abroad. The Provisional
Government based its financial policy upon &ldquo;reorganisation
of the Financial System on democratic lines and the direct
taxation of the propertied classes&rdquo; (Death Duties, Excess
Profits Taxes, Income Taxes, etc.). The Government, however,
would not adopt the measure recommended by the Revolutionary
Democracy&mdash;a compulsory loan or a high Capital Levy&mdash;a
measure distinctly tainted with Bolshevism. All these just taxes,
introduced or planned, did not suffice even partially to satisfy the
growing needs of the State. In the month of August the Finance
Ministry was compelled to increase indirect taxation on certain
monopolies, such as tea, sugar, and matches. These measures
were, of course, extremely burdensome, and therefore highly
unpopular.</p>

<p>Expenditure was growing, revenue was not forthcoming. The
Liberty Loan was not progressing favourably, and there could
be no hope for foreign loans on account of the condition of the
Russian Front. Internal loans and Treasury Bonds yielded
9&frac12; milliards in the first half of 1917. Ordinary revenue was
expected to yield 5,800,000,000 roubles. There remained one
weapon established by the historical tradition of every revolution&mdash;the
Printing Press.</p>

<p>Paper currency reached colossal proportions:</p>

<table summary="Paper currency">
<tr><td class="tdr padr">&frac12; 1914</td>
<td class="tdr">1,425,000,000&nbsp;</td>

<td class="tdc">&#12291;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></td></tr>
</table>

<p>According to the estimates of July, 1917, the total of paper
currency was 13,916,000,000 roubles (the gold reserve was
1,293,000,000 roubles), as against 2 milliards before the War.
Four successive Finance Ministers were unable to drag the country
out of the financial morass. This might possibly have been
achieved by the awakening of the national spirit and an understanding
of the interests of the State, or by the growth of
a wise and strong power which could have dealt a final
blow to the anti-State, selfish motives of the Bourgeois
elements that based their well-being upon the War and upon
the blood of the people, as well as of the Democracy, which, in
the words of Shingarev, &ldquo;so severely condemned through its
representatives in the Duma the very same poison (paper currency)
which it was now drinking greedily at the moment when that
Democracy had become its own master.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.</a><br />
<span class="smcap">The Strategical Position of the Russian Front.</span></h2>

<p>The first and fundamental question with which I was confronted
at the Stavka was <i>the objective of our Front</i>. The
condition of the enemy did not appear to us as particularly
brilliant. But I must confess that the truth as at present revealed
exceeds all our surmises, especially according to the picture drawn
by Hindenburg and Ludendorff of the condition of Germany and
of her Allies in 1917. I will not dwell upon the respective
numerical strength, armaments, and strategical positions on the
Western Front. I will only recall that in the middle of June
Hindenburg gave rather a gloomy description of the condition of
the country in his telegram to the Emperor. He said: &ldquo;We are
very much perturbed by the depression of the spirits of the people.
That spirit must be raised, <i>or we shall lose the War</i>. Our Allies
also require support, lest they desert us.... Economic
problems must be solved, which are of paramount importance to
our future. The question arises&mdash;Is the Chancellor capable of
solving them? A solution must be found <i>or else we perish</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Germans were anticipating a big offensive of the British
and the French on the Western Front, where they had concentrated
their main attention and their main forces, leaving on the
Eastern Front after the Russian Revolution only such numbers as
were scarcely sufficient for defence. And yet the position on the
Eastern Front continued to create a certain nervousness at the
German G.H.Q. Will the Russian people remain steadfast, or
will the Defeatist tendencies prevail? Hindenburg wrote: &ldquo;As
the condition of the Russian Army prevented us from finding a
clear answer to that question, our position in regard to Russia
remained insecure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In spite of all its defects, the Russian Army in March, 1917,
was a formidable force, with which the enemy had seriously to
reckon. Owing to the mobilisation of industry, to the activities
of the War-Industries Committees, and partly to the fact that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
War Ministry was showing increased energy, our armaments had
reached a level hitherto unknown. Also, the Allies were supplying
us with artillery and war materials through Murmansk and Archangel
on a larger scale. In the spring we had the powerful
Forty-Eighth Corps&mdash;a name under which heavy artillery of the
highest calibre for special purposes, &ldquo;Taon,&rdquo; was concealed. In
the beginning of the year the engineering troops were reorganised
and amplified. At the same time new infantry divisions were
beginning to deploy. This measure, adopted by General Gourko
during his temporary tenure of office as Chief-of-Staff of the
Supreme C.-in-C., consisted in the reduction of regiments from
four battalions to three, as well as the reduction of the number of
guns to a division. A third division was thus created in every
Army Corps, with artillery. There can be no doubt that, had
this scheme been introduced in peace-time, the Army Corps would
have been more pliable and considerably stronger. It was a
risky thing to do in war-time. Before the spring operations the
old divisions were disbanded, whereas the new ones were in a
pitiable state in regard to armaments (machine-guns, etc.), as well
as technical strength and equipment. Many of them had not been
sufficiently blended together&mdash;a circumstance of particular importance
in view of the Revolution. The position was so acute that
in May the Stavka was compelled to sanction the disbanding of
those of the Third Division which should prove feeble, and to
distribute the men among units of the line. This idea, however,
was hardly ever put into practice, as it encountered strong opposition
on the part of units already disaffected by the Revolution.
Another measure which weakened the ranks of the Army was the
dismissal of the senior men in the ranks.</p>

<p>This decision, fraught with incalculable consequences, was
taken on the eve of a general offensive. It was due to a statement
made at a Council at the Stavka by the Minister of Agriculture
(who was also in charge of supplies) that the condition of supplies
was critical, and that he could not undertake the responsibility of
feeding the Army unless about a million men were removed from
the ration list. In the debate attention was drawn to the presence
in the Army of an enormous number of non-combatants, quite out
of proportion to the numbers of fighting men, and to the inclusion
in the Army of a quantity of auxiliary bodies, which were hardly
necessary, such as of Labour Organisations, Chinese, and other
alien Labour Battalions, etc. Mention was also made of the
necessity of having a younger Army. I very much feared this
trend of mind, and gave orders to the Staff to draw up accurate
lists of all the above-named Capitalists. While this work was still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
in preparation the War Minister issued, on April 5th, an Order of
the Day giving leave, in the internal districts, to soldiers over
forty to work in the fields till May 15th. Leave was afterwards
extended till June 15th, but practically hardly anyone
returned. On April 10th the Provisional Government discharged
all men over forty-three. Under the pressure of the men it became
unavoidable to spread the provisions of the first Order to the
Army, which would not be reconciled to any privileges granted
to the rear. The second Order gave rise to a very dangerous
tendency, as it practically amounted to a <i>beginning of demobilisation</i>.
The elemental desire of those who had been given leave to
return to their homes could not be controlled by any regulations,
and the masses of these men, who flooded the railway stations,
caused a protracted disorganisation of the means of transport.
Some regiments formed out of Reserve battalions lost most of
their men. In the rear of the Army transport was likewise in a
state of confusion. The men did not wait to be relieved, but left
the lorries and the horses to their fate; supplies were plundered
and the horses perished. The Army was weakened as a result of
these circumstances, and the preparations for the defensive were
delayed.</p>

</div>

<p>The Russian Army occupied an enormous Front, from the
Baltic to the Black Sea and from the Black Sea to Hamadan.
Sixty-eight infantry and nine cavalry corps occupied the line.
Both the importance of and the conditions obtaining on these
Fronts varied. Our Northern Front, including Finland, the
Baltic and the line of the Western Dvina, was of great
importance, as it covered the approaches to Petrograd. But the
importance at that Front was limited to defensive purposes, and
for that reason it was impossible to keep at that Front large
forces or considerable numbers of guns. The conditions of that
Theatre&mdash;the strong defensive line of the Dvina&mdash;a series of
natural positions in the rear linked up with the main positions of
the Western Russian Front, and the impossibility of any important
operations in the direction of Petrograd without taking possession
of the Sea, which was in our hands&mdash;all this would have justified
us in considering that the Front was, to a certain extent, secure,
had it not been for two circumstances, which caused the Stavka
serious concern: The troops of the Northern Front, owing to the
vicinity of Revolutionary Petrograd, were more demoralised than
any other, and the Baltic Fleet and its bases&mdash;Helsingfors and
Kronstadt, of which the latter served as the main base of
Anarchism and Bolshevism&mdash;were either &ldquo;autonomous&rdquo; or in a
state of semi-Anarchy. While preserving to a certain degree the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a><br /><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
outward form of discipline, the Baltic Fleet was actually in a
state of complete insubordination. The Admiral in command,
Maximov, was entirely in the hands of the Central Committee of
Sailors. Not a single order for Naval operations could be carried
out without the sanction of that Committee, not to speak of Naval
actions. Even the work of laying and repairing minefields&mdash;the
main defence of the Baltic&mdash;met with opposition from Sailors&rsquo;
Organisations and the crews. Not only the general decline of
discipline, but the well-planned work of the German General Staff
were quite obvious, and apprehensions were entertained lest Naval
secrets and codes be revealed to the enemy. At the same time,
the troops of the Forty-Second Corps, quartered along the Finnish
Coast and on the Monzund Islands, had been idle for a long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
time and their positions scattered. With the beginning of the
Revolution they were, therefore, rapidly demoralised, and some
of them were nothing but physically and morally degenerate
crowds. To relieve or to move them was an impossibility. I
recall that in May, 1917, I made several unavailing endeavours to
send an Infantry Brigade to the Monzund Islands. Suffice it to
say that the Army Corps Commander would not make up his
mind to inspect his troops and get into touch with them&mdash;a
circumstance which is typical of the troops as well as of the
personality of their Commander. In a word, the position on the
Northern Front in the spring of 1917 was the following: We
received daily reports of the Channel between the Islands of the
Gulf of Riga and the mainland being blocked with ice, and this
ice appeared to be the chief real obstacle to an invasion of the
German Fleet and Expeditionary Forces.</p>

<p>The Western Front extended from the Disna to the Pripet.
On this long line two sectors&mdash;Minsk-Vilna and Minsk-Baranovitchi&mdash;were
of the greatest importance to us, as they
represented the two directions in which our troops, as well as the
Germans, might undertake offensive operations, for which there
had already been precedents. The other sections of the Front,
and especially the Southern&mdash;the Pollessie, with its forests and
marshes&mdash;owing to the conditions of the country and of the railways,
were passive. Along the River Pripet, its tributaries and
canals, a kind of half-peaceful intercourse with the Germans had
long since been established, as well as a secret exchange of
goods, which was of some advantage to the &ldquo;Comrades.&rdquo; For
example, we received reports that Russian soldiers from the Line,
with bags, appeared daily in the market of Pinsk, and that their
advent was for many reasons encouraged by the German
authorities. There was another vulnerable point&mdash;the bridge-head
on the Stokhod by the station, Chrevishe-Golenin, occupied
by one of the Army Corps of General Lesh. On March 21st, after
strong artillery preparation and a gas attack, the Germans fell
upon our Corps and smashed it to pieces. Our troops had heavy
casualties, and the remnants of the Corps retreated behind the
Stokhod. The Stavka did not get an accurate list of the
casualties, because it was impossible to ascertain the numbers of
killed or wounded under the head of &ldquo;Missing.&rdquo; The German
Official CommuniquÃ© gave a list of prisoners&mdash;150 officers and
about 10,000 men. Owing to the conditions in that theatre of
war, this tactical success was of no strategical importance, and
could lead to no dangerous developments. Nevertheless, we
could not but wonder at the frankness of the cautious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
<i>Norddeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung</i>, the official organ of the
German Chancellor, which wrote: &ldquo;The CommuniquÃ© of the
Stavka of the Russian Supreme Command of March 29th is mistaken
in interpreting the operations undertaken by the German
troops, and dictated by a tactical necessity which had arisen
only within the limits of a given sector, was an operation of general
importance.&rdquo; The paper knew the facts of which we were not
certain and which have now been explained by Ludendorff. From
the beginning of the Russian Revolution, Germany had a new
aim: <i>Unable to conduct operations on both the main Fronts,
she had decided attentively to follow and to encourage the process
of demoralisation in Russia, striking at her not by arms, but by
developing propaganda</i>. The battle of the Stokhod was fought
on the personal initiative of General Linsingen, and the German
Government was frightened because it considered that &ldquo;at a
moment when fraternisation was proceeding at full speed&rdquo;
German attacks might revive the dying flames of patriotism in
Russia and postpone her collapse. The Chancellor asked
the German G.H.Q. to make as little as possible of that success,
and the G.H.Q. cancelled all further offensives &ldquo;in order not to
dash the hopes for peace which were about to be realised.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Our reverse on the Stokhod produced a strong impression in
the country. It was the first fighting experience of the &ldquo;Freest
Revolutionary Army in the world....&rdquo; The Stavka merely
gave the facts in a spirit of impartiality. In the circles of the
Revolutionary Democracy the reverse was explained partly by the
treachery of the Commanding Officers and partly by a conspiracy
to emphasise by this example the impracticability of the new Army
Regulations and the danger of the collapse of discipline, partly by
the incompetence of the military authorities. The Moscow Soviet
wrote to the Stavka accusing one of the assistants of the War
Minister who had commanded a division on that Front of being
a traitor. Others attributed our defeat solely to the demoralisation
of the troops. In reality, the reasons for the defeat were two-fold:
The <i>tactical</i> reason&mdash;the doubtful practicability of occupying
a narrow bridge-head when the river was swollen, the insecurity of
the rear and perhaps inadequate use of the troops and of technical
means; and the <i>psychological</i> reason, the collapse of the <i>moral</i> and
of the discipline of the troops. The last circumstance, apparent
in the enormous number of prisoners, gave both the Russian
Stavka and Hindenburg&rsquo;s headquarters much food for thought.</p>

<p>The South-Western Front, from the Pripet to Moldavia, was
the most important, and attracted the greatest attention. From
that Front, operating lines of the highest importance led to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
North-West, into the depths of Galicia and Poland, to Cracow,
Warsaw and Brest-Litovsk. The advance along these lines was
covered from the South by the Carpathians, separated the Southern
Austrian group of armies from the Northern German, and
threatened the rear and the communications of the latter. These
operating lines, upon which no serious obstacles were encountered,
led us to the Front of the Austrian troops, whose fighting capacity
was lower than the Germans. The rear of our South-Western
Front was comparatively well-organised and prosperous. The
psychology of the troops, of the Command, and of the Staffs
always differed considerably from the psychology of other Fronts.
In the glorious, but joyless, campaign only the armies of the
South-Western Front had won splendid victories, had taken
hundreds of thousands of prisoners, had made victorious progress
hundreds of miles deep into the enemy territory, and had descended
into Hungary from the Carpathians. These troops had formerly
always believed in success. Brussilov, Kornilov, Kaledin had
made their reputations on that Front. Owing to all these circumstances
the South-Western Front was regarded as the natural
base and the centre of the impending operations. Consequently,
troops, technical means, the greater part of the heavy artillery
(&ldquo;Taon&rdquo;) and munitions were concentrated at that Front. The
region between the Upper Seret and the Carpathians was, therefore,
being prepared for the offensive, <i>Places d&rsquo;armes</i> erected,
roads made. Further south there was the Roumanian Front,
stretching to the Black Sea. After the unsuccessful campaign
of 1916 our troops occupied the line of the Danube, the Seret and
the Carpathians, and it was sufficiently fortified. Part of General
Averesco&rsquo;s Roumanian troops occupied the Front between our
Fourth and Ninth Armies, and part were being organised under
the direction of the French General, Berthelot, assisted by Russian
Gunner Instructors. The reorganisation and formation proceeded
favourably, the more so as the Roumanian soldier is excellent
war material. I became acquainted with the Roumanian Army
in November, 1916, when I was sent with the Eighth Army Corps
to Buseo, into the thick of the retreating Roumanian Armies.
Curiously enough, I was ordered to advance in the direction of
Bucarest until I came into contact with the enemy, and to cover
that direction with the assistance of the retreating Roumanian
troops. For several months I fought by Buseo, Rymnik and
Fokshany, having two Roumanian Corps at times under my command
and Averesco&rsquo;s Army on my flank. I thus gained a
thorough knowledge of the Roumanian troops. In the beginning
of the campaign the Roumanian Army showed complete<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
disregard of the experience of the World War. In matters of
equipment and ammunition their levity was almost criminal.
There were several capable Generals, the officers were effeminate
and inefficient, and the men were splendid. The artillery was
adequate, but the infantry was untrained. These are the main
characteristics of the Roumanian Army, which soon afterwards
acquired better organisation and improved in training and equipment.
The relations between the actual Russian Commander-in-Chief,
who was designated as the Assistant C.-in-C., and the
King of Roumania, who was nominally in Chief Command, were
fairly cordial. Although the Russian troops began to commit
excesses, which had a bad effect upon the attitude of the
Roumanians, the condition of the Front did not, however, cause
serious apprehension. Owing to the general conditions at the
Theatre of War, only an advance in great strength in the direction
of Bucarest and an invasion of Transylvania could have had
a political and strategical effect. But new forces could not be
moved to Roumania, and the condition of the Roumanian Railways
excluded all hope of the possibility of transport and supplies
on a large scale. The theatre, therefore, was of secondary
importance, and the troops of the Roumanian Front were preparing
for a local operation, with a view to attracting the Austro-German
forces.</p>

<p>The Caucasian Front was in an exceptional position. It was far
distant. For many years the Caucasian Administration and
Command had enjoyed a certain degree of autonomy. From
August, 1916, the Army was commanded by the Grand-Duke
Nicholas, a man of commanding personality, who took advantage
of his position whenever there was a difference of opinion
between himself and the Stavka. Finally, the natural conditions
of the theatre of war and the peculiarities of the enemy rendered
that Front entirely different from the European. All this led to
a kind of remoteness and aloofness of the Caucasian Army and
too abnormal relations with the Stavka. General Alexeiev
repeatedly stated that, in spite of all his efforts, he was unable
clearly to discern the situation in the Caucasus. The Caucasus
lived independently, and told the Government only as much as
it considered necessary; and the reports were coloured in accordance
with local interests.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1917 the Caucasian Army was in a difficult
position, not by reason of the strategical or fighting advantages
of the enemy&mdash;the Turkish Army was by no means a serious
menace&mdash;but of internal disorganisation. The countryside was
roadless and bare. There were no supplies or forage, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
difficulties of transport made the life of the troops very arduous.
The Army Corps on the Right Flank was comparatively well
supplied, owing to facilities for transport across the Black Sea,
but the other Army Corps, and especially those of the Left Flank,
fared very badly. Owing to geographical conditions, light transport
required an enormous number of horses, while there was no
fodder on the spot. Railways of all kinds were being built very
slowly, partly owing to a lack of railway material and partly
because that material had been wasted by the Caucasian Front
upon the Trapezund Railway, which was of secondary importance,
owing to the parallel Maritime transport. In the beginning of
May General Yudenitch reported that, owing to disease and loss
of horses, transport was completely disorganised, batteries in
position had no horses, half of the transport was non-existent,
and 75,000 horses were needed. Tracks, rolling stock and forage
were urgently required. In the first half of April 30,000 men (22
per cent.) of the Infantry of the Line had died of typhus
and scurvy. Yudenitch therefore foreshadowed the necessity of
a compulsory retreat to points of supply, the centre towards
Erzerum and the Right Flank to the frontier. The solution
suggested by General Yudenitch could not be accepted, both for
moral reasons and because our retreat would have freed Turkish
troops for action on other Asiatic Fronts. This circumstance
particularly worried the British Military Representative at the
Stavka, who repeatedly conveyed to us the desire of the British
G.H.Q. that the Left Flank of our troops should advance in the
valley of the River Diala for a combined operation with General
Maude&rsquo;s Mesopotamian contingent against Halil Pasha&rsquo;s Army.
This advance was necessary to the British rather for political
considerations than for strategical requirements. The actual
condition of our Left Flank Army Corps was, moreover, truly
desperate, and in May tropical heat set in in the valley of the
Diala. As a result the Caucasian Front was unable to advance,
and was ordered actively to defend its position. The advance of
the Army Corps of the Left Flank, in contact with the British,
was made conditional upon the latter supplying the troops. As
a matter of fact, in the middle of April, a partial retreat took
place in the direction of Ognot and Mush; at the end of April the
Left Flank began its fruitless advance in the valley of the Diala,
and subsequently a condition arose on the Caucasian Front which
was something between War and Peace.</p>

<p>In conclusion, mention must be made of another portion of
the Armed Forces of Russia in that theatre&mdash;the Black Sea Fleet.
In May and in the beginning of June serious disturbances had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
already occurred, which led to the resignation of Admiral
Koltchak. The Fleet, however, was still considered strong enough
to carry out its task&mdash;to hold the Black Sea and also to blockade
the Turkish and Bulgarian coasts and guard the maritime routes
to the Caucasian and Roumanian Fronts.</p>

<p>I have given a short summary of the conditions of the Russian
Front without indulging in a detailed examination of strategical
possibilities. Whatever our strategy during that period may have
been, it was upset by the masses of the soldiery, for from
Petrograd to the Danube and the Diala demoralisation was
spreading and growing. In the beginning of the Revolution it
was impossible to gauge the extent of its effects upon various
fronts and upon future operations. But many were those whose
minds were poisoned by a suspicion as to the futility of all our
plans, calculations and efforts.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.</a><br />
<span class="smcap">The Question of the Advance of the Russian Army.</span></h2>

<p>We were thus confronted with a crucial question: SHOULD
THE RUSSIAN ARMY ADVANCE?</p>

<p>On March 27th the Provisional Government issued a
proclamation &ldquo;To the Citizens&rdquo; on the subject of war aims.
The Stavka could not detect any definite instructions for
governing the Russian Army in the midst of a series of phrases
in which the true meaning of the appeal was obscured in deference
to the Revolutionary Democracy. &ldquo;The Defence at all costs of
our national patrimony and the liberation of the country from
the enemy who has invaded it is the first and vital aim of our
soldiers, who are defending the freedom of the people....
Free Russia does not aim at domination over other peoples, at
depriving them of <i>their</i> national patrimony, or at the forcible
seizure of foreign territories. She aims at a lasting peace, on the
basis of the self-determination of peoples. The Russian people
do not wish to increase their external power at the expense of
other peoples ... but ... will not allow their Mother
Country to come out of the great struggle downtrodden and
weakened. These principles will constitute the basis of the
Foreign Policy of the Provisional Government ... <i>while all
the obligations to our Allies will be respected</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the Note of April 18th, addressed to the Allied Powers by
the Foreign Minister, Miliukov, we find yet another definition:
&ldquo;The universal desire of the people to carry the World War to
a victorious conclusion ... has grown owing to the
consciousness of the common responsibility of everyone. This
desire has become more active, because it is concentrated on the
aim which is immediate and clear to everyone&mdash;<i>that of repelling
the enemy who has invaded the territory of our Mother Country</i>.&rdquo;
These, of course, were mere phrases, which described the War
aims in cautious, timorous and nebulous words, allowing of any
interpretation, and deprived, moreover, any foundation in fact.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
The will for victory in the people and in the Army had not only
not grown, but was steadily decreasing, as a result of weariness
and waning patriotism, as well as of the intense work of the
abnormal coalition between the representatives of the extreme
elements of the Russian Revolutionary Democracy and the
German General Staff. That coalition was formed by ties which
were unseen and yet quite perceptible. I will deal with that
question later, and will only say here that the destructive work,
in accordance with the Zimmerwald programme, for ending the
War began long before the Revolution and was conducted from
within as well as from without. The Provisional Government
was trying to pacify the militant element of the Revolutionary
Democracy by expounding meaningless and obscure formulas
with regard to the War aims, but it did not interfere with the
Stavka in regard to the choice of strategical means. We were,
therefore, to decide the question of the advance independently
from the prevailing currents of political opinion. The only clear
and definite object upon which the Commanding Staffs could not
fail to agree was to defeat the enemy in close union with the
Allies. Otherwise our country was doomed to destruction.</p>

<p>Such a decision implied an advance on a large scale because
victory was impossible without it, and a devastating war might
otherwise become protracted. The responsible organs of the
Democracy, the majority of whom had Defeatist tendencies, tried
correspondingly to influence the masses. Even the moderate
Socialist circles were not altogether free from these tendencies.
The masses of the soldiery utterly failed to understand the ideas
behind of the Zimmerwald programme; but the programme itself
offered a certain justification for the elementary feelings of self-preservation.
In other words, it was a question with them of
saving their skin. The idea of an advance could not, therefore,
be particularly popular with the Army, as demoralisation was
growing. There was no certainty not only that the advance would
be successful, but even that the troops would obey the order to
go forward. The colossal Russian Front was still steady ...
by the force of inertia. The enemy feared it, as, like ourselves,
he was unable to gauge its potential strength. What if the
advance were to disclose our impotence?</p>

<p>Such were the motives adduced against an advance. But
there were too many weighty reasons in favour of it, and these
reasons were imperative. The Central Powers had exhausted
their strength, moral and material, and their man power. If our
advance in the autumn of 1916, which had no decisive strategical
results, had placed the enemy forces in a critical position, what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
might not happen now, when we had become stronger and,
technically better equipped, when we had the advantage in
numbers, and the Allies were planning a decisive blow in the
spring of 1917? The Germans were awaiting the blow with
feverish anxiety, and in order to avert it they had retreated thirty
miles on a front of 100 miles between Arras and Soissons to the
so-called Hindenburg line, after causing incredibly ruthless and
inexcusable devastation to the relinquished territory. This retreat
was significant, as it was an indication of the enemy&rsquo;s weakness,
and gave rise to great hopes. <i>We had to advance.</i> Our
intelligence service was completely destroyed by the suspicions of
the Revolutionary Democracy, which had foolishly believed that
this service was identical with the old secret police organisation,
and had therefore abolished it. Many of the delegates of the
Soviet were in touch with the German agents. The fronts were
in close contact, and espionage was rendered very easy. In these
circumstances our decision not to advance would have been
undoubtedly communicated to the enemy, who would have
immediately commenced the transference of his troops to the
Western Front. This would have been tantamount to treason to
our Allies, and would have inevitably led to a separate peace&mdash;with
all its consequences&mdash;if not officially, at least practically.
The attitude of the revolutionary elements in Petrograd in this
matter was, however, so unstable that the Stavka had at first
suspected&mdash;without any real foundation&mdash;the Provisional
Government itself.</p>

<p>This caused the following incident: At the end of April, in
the temporary absence of the Supreme C.-in-C., the Chief of the
Diplomatic Chancery reported to me that the Allied Military
Attaches were greatly perturbed because a telegram had just been
received from the Italian Ambassador at Petrograd, in which he
categorically stated that the Provisional Government had decided
to conclude a separate peace with the Central Powers. When the
receipt of a telegram had been ascertained, I sent a telegram to
the War Minister, because I was then unaware of the fact that
the Italian Embassy, owing to the impulsiveness of its personnel,
had more than once been the channel through which false rumours
had been spread. My telegram was most emphatic, and ended
thus: &ldquo;Posterity will stigmatise with deep contempt the weak-kneed,
impotent, irresolute generation which was good enough
to destroy the rotten rÃ©gime, but not good enough to preserve
the honour, the dignity, and the very existence of Russia.&rdquo; The
misunderstanding was painful indeed; the news was false, the
Government was not thinking of a separate peace. Later, at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
fateful sitting of the Conference at the Stavka of Commanders-in-Chief
and members of the Government, on July 16th, I had an
opportunity of expressing my views once more. I said: &ldquo;...
There is another way&mdash;the way of treason. It would give a
respite to our distressed country.... But the curse of
treachery will not give us happiness. At the end of that way there
is slavery&mdash;political, economical, and moral.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I am aware that in certain Russian circles such a straightforward
profession of moral principles in politics was afterwards
condemned. It was stated that such idealism is misplaced and
pernicious, that the interests of Russia must be considered above
all &ldquo;conventional political morality.&rdquo;... A people, however,
lives not for years, but for centuries, and I am certain that,
had we then altered the course of our external policy, the sufferings
of the Russian people would not have been materially
affected, and the gruesome, blood-stained game with marked
cards would have continued ... at the expense of the
people. The psychology of the Russian military leaders did not
allow of such a change, of such a compromise with conscience.
Alexeiev and Kornilov, abandoned by all and unsupported, continued
for a long time to follow that path, trusting and relying
upon the common-sense, if not the noble spirit, of the Allies and
preferring to be betrayed rather than betray.</p>

<p>Was that playing the part of a Don Quixote? It may be so.
But the other policy would have had to be conducted by other
hands less clean. As regards myself, three years later, having
lost all my illusions and borne the heavy blows of fortune, having
knocked against the solid wall of the overt and blind egoism of
the &ldquo;friendly&rdquo; powers, and being therefore free from all obligations
towards the Allies, almost on the eve of the final betrayal
by these powers of the real Russia, I remained the convinced
advocate of <i>honest policy</i>. Now the tables are turned. At the
end of April, 1920, I had to try and convince British Members of
Parliament that a healthy national policy cannot be free from all
moral principles, and that an obvious crime was being committed
because no other name could be given to the abandonment of the
armed forces of the Crimea to the discontinuance of the struggle
against Bolshevism, its introduction into the family of civilised
nations, and to its indirect recognition; that this would prolong
for a short while the days of Bolshevism in Russia, but would open
wide the gates of Europe to Bolshevism. I am firmly convinced
that the Nemesis of history will not forgive <span class="small">THEM</span>, as it would not
have then forgiven us. The beginning of 1917 was a moment of
acute peril for the Central Powers and a decisive moment for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
Entente. The question of the Russian advance greatly perturbed
the Allied High Command. General Barter, the Representative
of Great Britain, and General Janin, the French Representative
at Russian Headquarters, often visited the Supreme C.-in-C. and
myself, and made inquiries on the subject. But the statements of
the German Press, with reference to pressure from the Allies and
to ultimatums to the Stavka, are incorrect. These would have
simply been useless, because Janin and Barter understood the
situation, and knew that it was the condition of the Army that
hindered the beginning of the advance. They tried to hurry and
to increase technical assistance, while their more impulsive compatriots&mdash;Thomas,
Henderson, and Vandervelde&mdash;were making
hopeless endeavours to fan the flame of patriotism by their impassioned
appeals to the Representatives of the Russian Revolutionary
Democracy and to the troops.</p>

<p>The Stavka also took into consideration the strong probability
that the Russian Army would have rapidly and finally collapsed
had it been left in a passive condition and deprived of all impulses
for active hostilities, whereas a successful advance might lift and
heal the <i>moral</i>, if not through sheer patriotism, at least through
the intoxication of a great victory. Such feelings might have
counteracted all international formulas sown by the enemy on the
fertile soil of the Defeatist tendencies of the Socialistic Party.
Victory would have given external peace, and some chance of
peace within. Defeat opened before the country an abyss. The
risk was inevitable, and was justified by the aim of saving Russia.
The Supreme Commander-in-Chief, the Quartermaster-General,
and myself fully agreed as to the necessity of an advance. And
this view was shared in principle by the Senior Commanding
Officers. Different views were held on various Fronts as to the
degree of fighting capacity of the troops and as to their preparedness.
I am thoroughly convinced that the decision itself independently
of its execution rendered the Allies a great service, because
the forces, the means, and the attention of the enemy were kept
on the Russian Front, which, although it had lost its former formidable
power, still remained a potential danger to the enemy.
The same question, curiously enough, was confronting Hindenburg&rsquo;s
Headquarters. Ludendorff writes: &ldquo;The general position
in April and in May precluded the possibility of important operations
on the Eastern Front.&rdquo; Later, however, &ldquo;... there
were great discussions on the subject at G.H.Q. Would not a
rapid advance on the Eastern Front with the available troops,
reinforced by a few divisions from the West, offer a better chance
than mere waiting? It was a most propitious moment, as some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
people said, for smashing the Russian Army, when its fighting
capacity had deteriorated.... I disagreed, in spite of the
fact that our position in the West had improved. I would not do
anything that might destroy the real chances of peace.&rdquo; Ludendorff
means, of course, separate peace. What such a peace was
to be we learnt later, at Brest-Litovsk....</p>

<p>The Armies were given directions for a new offensive. The
general idea was to break through the enemy positions on sectors
specially prepared on all European fronts, to advance on a broad
front in great strength on the South-Western Front, in the direction
from Kamenetz-Podolsk to Lvov, and further to the line of
the Vistula, while the striking force of our Western Front was
to advance from Molodetchno to Vilna and the Niemen, throwing
back northwards the German Armies of General Eichorn. The
Northern and the Roumanian Fronts were to co-operate by dealing
local blows and attracting the forces of the enemy. The time
for the advance was not definitely fixed, and a broad margin was
allowed. But the days went by, and the troops, who had hitherto
obeyed orders and carried out the most difficult tasks without a
murmur, the same troops that had hitherto withstood the onset
of the Austro-German Armies with naked breasts, without cartridges
or shells, now stood with their will-power paralysed and
their reason obscured. The offensive was still further delayed.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Allies, who had been preparing a big operation
for the spring, as they had counted upon strong reinforcements
being brought up by the enemy in the event of the complete
collapse of the Russian Front, began the great battle in France,
as had been planned, at the end of March, and <i>without awaiting</i>
the final decision on our advance. The Allied Headquarters,
however, did not consider simultaneous action as a necessary
condition of the contemplated operations, even before disaffection
had begun in the Russian Army. Owing to the natural conditions
of our Front we were not expected to begin the advance
before the month of May. Meanwhile, according to the general
plan of campaign for 1917, which had been drawn up in November,
1916, at the Conference at Chantilly, General Joffre intended
to begin the advance of the Anglo-French Army at the end of
January and the beginning of February. General Nivelle, who
superseded him, altered the date to the end of March after the
Conference at Calais of February 14th, 1917. The absence of
co-ordination between the Western and Eastern European Fronts
was bearing bitter fruit. It is difficult to tell whether the Allies
would have deferred their spring offensive for two months, and
whether the advances of a combined operation with the Russian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
Front would have been a compensation for the delay, which gave
Germany the opportunity of reinforcing and reorganising her
armies. One thing is certain&mdash;that that lack of co-ordination gave
the Germans a great respite. Ludendorff wrote: &ldquo;I detest
useless discussions, but I cannot fail to think of what would have
happened had Russia advanced in April and May and had won a
few minor victories. We would have been faced, as in the autumn
of 1916, with a fierce struggle. Our munitions would have reached
a very low ebb. After careful consideration, I fail to see how our
High Command could have remained the master of the situation
had the Russians obtained in April and May even the same scant
successes which crowned their efforts in June. In April and May
of 1917, in spite of our victory (?) on the Aisne and in Champagne,
it was only the Russian Revolution that saved us.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Apart from the general advance on the Austro-German Front,
another question of considerable interest arose in April&mdash;that of
an <i>independent operation for the conquest of Constantinople</i>.
Inspired by young and spirited naval officers, the Foreign
Minister, Miliukov, repeatedly negotiated with Alexeiev, and tried
to persuade him to undertake that operation, which he considered
likely to be successful, and which would, in his opinion, confront
the Revolutionary Democracy, which was protesting against
annexations, with an accomplished fact. The Stavka disapproved
of this undertaking, as the condition of our troops would not
permit of it. The landing of an Expeditionary Force&mdash;in itself a
very delicate task&mdash;demanded stringent discipline, preparation,
and perfect order. What is more, the Expeditionary Force, which
would lose touch with the main Army, should be imbued with a
very strong sense of duty. To have the sea in the rear is a circumstance
which depresses even troops with a very strong <i>moral</i>.
These elements had already ceased to exist in the Russian Army.
The Minister&rsquo;s requests were becoming, however, so urgent that
General Alexeiev deemed it necessary to give him an object-lesson,
and a small Expedition was planned to the Turkish coast of Asia
Minor. As far as I can remember, Zunguldak was the objective.
This insignificant operation required a detachment consisting of
one Infantry Regiment, one Armoured Car Division, and a small
Cavalry contingent, and was to have been carried out by the
troops of the Roumanian Front. After a while the Headquarters
of that Front had shamefacedly to report that the detachment
could not be formed because the troops declined to join the Expeditionary
Force. This episode was due to a foolish interpretation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
of the idea of peace without annexations, which distorted the very
principles of strategy and was also, perhaps, due to the same
instinct of self-preservation. It was another ill omen for the
impending general advance. That advance was still being
prepared, painfully and desperately.</p>

<p>The rusty, notched Russian sword was still brandished. The
question was, when would it stop and upon whose head would it
fall?</p>

<p class="chapsummary"><span class="smcap">Military Reforms&mdash;The Generals&mdash;The Dismissal from the
High Command.</span></p>

<p>Preparations for the advance continued alongside of the
so-called &ldquo;Democratisation.&rdquo; These phenomena must be
here recorded, as they had a decisive effect upon the issue of the
summer offensive and upon the final destinies of the Army.
Military reforms began by the dismissal of vast numbers of
Commanding Generals. In military circles this was described, in
tragic jest, as &ldquo;The slaughter of the innocents.&rdquo; It opened
with the conversation between the War Minister, Gutchkov, and
the General on duty at the Stavka, Komzerovski. At the
Minister&rsquo;s request the General drew up a list of the Senior Commanding
Officers, with short notes (records of service). This
list, afterwards completed by various people who enjoyed
Gutchkov&rsquo;s confidence, served as a basis for the &ldquo;slaughter.&rdquo; In
the course of a few weeks 150 Senior Officers, including seventy
Commanders of Infantry and Cavalry Divisions, were placed on
the Retired List. In his speech to the Delegates of the Front on
April 29th, 1917, Gutchkov gave the following reasons for this
measure: &ldquo;It has been our first task, after the beginning of the
Revolution, to make room for talent. Among our Commanding
Officers there were many honest men; but some of them were
unable to grasp the new principles of intercourse, and in a short
time more changes have been made in our commanding personnel
than have ever been made before in any army.... I
realised that there could be no mercy in this case, and I was merciless
to those whom I considered incapable. Of course, I may
have been wrong. There may have been dozens of mistakes, but
I consulted knowledgeable people and took decisions only when
I felt that they were in keeping with the general opinion. At any
rate, we have promoted all those who have proved their capacity
among the Commanding Officers. I disregarded hierarchical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
considerations. There are men who commanded regiments in the
beginning of the War and are now commanding armies....
We have thus attained not only an improvement, but something
different and equally important. By proclaiming the watchword
&lsquo;Room for talent&rsquo; we have instilled joy into the hearts, and
have induced the officers to work with impetus and inspiration....&rdquo;</p>

<p>What did the Army gain by such drastic changes? Did the
<i>cadres</i> of the Commanding Officers really improve? In my
opinion that object was not attained. New men appeared on the
scene, owing to the newly-introduced right of selecting assistants,
not without the interference of our old friends&mdash;family ties,
friendship and wire-pulling. Could the Revolution give new
birth to men or make them perfect? Was a mechanical change of
personnel capable of killing a system which for many years had
weakened the impulse for work and for self-improvement? It
may be that some talented individuals did come to the fore, but
there were also dozens, nay, hundreds, of men whose promotion
was due to accident and not to knowledge or energy. This
accidental character of appointments was further intensified when
later Kerensky abolished for the duration of the War all the
existing qualifications, as well as the correlation of rank and
office. The qualification of knowledge and experience was also
thereby set aside. I have before me a list of the Senior
Commanding Officers of the Russian Army in the middle of May,
1917, when Gutchkov&rsquo;s &ldquo;slaughter&rdquo; had been accomplished.
The list includes the Supreme Commander-in-Chief, the
Commanders-in-Chief of Fronts, Armies and Fleets, and their
Chiefs of Staff&mdash;altogether forty-five men:</p>

<p>I have excluded five names, as I have no data about them.</p>

<p>These men were the brain, the soul and the will-power of the
Army. It is difficult to estimate their military capacity according
to their last tenures of office, because strategy and military
science in 1917 had almost entirely ceased to be applied and became
slavishly subservient to the soldiery, but I know the activities of
these men in regard to the struggle against democratisation&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>,
the disruption of the Army, and the above table indicates the three
groups into which they were divided. Subsequently, after 1918,
some of these men took part in the struggle or kept aloof from
it.</p>

<p>Such are the results of the changes in the High Command,
where men were in the public eye and where their activities
attracted the critical attention not only of the Government, but
of military and social circles. I think that in the lower grades
things were no better. The question of the justice of this measure
may be open to discussion, but, personally, I have no doubt
whatsoever about its extreme impracticability. The dismissal <i>en
masse</i> of Army Chiefs definitely undermined the faith in the
Commanding Staffs, and afforded an excuse for the arbitrariness
and violence of the Committees and of the men towards individual
representatives of the Commanding Staff. Constant changes and
transfers removed most officers from their units, where they may
have enjoyed respect and authority acquired by military prowess.
These men were thrown into new circles strange to them, and
time was needed, as well as difficult work, in the new and
fundamentally changed atmosphere in order to regain that respect
and authority. The formation of Third Infantry Divisions was
still proceeding, and was also occasioning constant changes in
the Commanding Personnel. That chaos was bound to ensue as
a result of all these circumstances is fairly obvious. So delicate a
machine as the Army was in the days of War and Revolution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
could only be kept going by the force of inertia, and could not
withstand new commotions. Pernicious elements, of course,
should have been removed and the system of appointments altered,
and the path opened for those who were worthy; beyond that the
matter ought to have been allowed to follow its natural course
without laying too much stress upon it and without devising a
new system. Apart from the Commanding Officers who were thus
removed, several Generals resigned of their own accord&mdash;such as
Letchitzki and Mistchenko&mdash;who could not be reconciled to the
new rÃ©gime, and many Commanders who were evicted in a
Revolutionary fashion by the direct or indirect pressure of the
Committee or of the soldiery. Admiral Koltchak was one of them.
Further changes were made, prompted by varying and sometimes
self-contradictory views upon the Army Administration. These
changes were, therefore, very fitful, and prevented a definite type
of Commanding Officer from being introduced.</p>

<p>Alexeiev dismissed the Commander-in-Chief, Ruzsky, and the
Army Commander, Radko-Dmitriev, for their weakness and
opportunism. He visited the Northern Front, and, having gained
an unfavourable impression of the activities of these Generals, he
discreetly raised the question of their being &ldquo;overworked.&rdquo; That
is the interpretation given by the Army and Society to these
dismissals.</p>

<p>Brussilov dismissed Yudenitch for the same reasons. I
dismissed an Army Commander (Kvietsinski) because his will
and authority were subservient to the disorganising activities of
the Committees who were democratising the Army.</p>

<p>Kerensky dismissed the Supreme Commander-in-Chief and the
Commanders-in-Chief, Gourko and Dragomirov, because they
were strenuously opposed to the democratisation of the Army.
He also dismissed Brussilov for the opposite motives, because
Brussilov was an Opportunist, pure and simple.</p>

<p>Brussilov dismissed the Commander of the Eighth Army,
General Kaledin&mdash;who later became the Ataman of the Don and
was universally respected&mdash;on the plea that he had &ldquo;lost heart&rdquo;
and did not approve of democratisation. This dismissal of a
General with a magnificent War record was effected in a rude and
offensive manner. He was at first offered the command of another
Army, and then offered to retire. Kaledin then wrote to me:
&ldquo;My record entitles me to be treated otherwise than as a stop-gap,
without taking my own views into consideration.&rdquo;</p>

<p>General Vannovski, who was relieved of the command of an
Army Corps by the Army Commander because he refused to
acknowledge the priority of the Army Committee, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
immediately appointed by the Stavka to a Higher Command and
given an Army on the South-Western Front.</p>

<p>General Kornilov, who had refused the Chief Command of the
troops of the Petrograd District, &ldquo;because he considered it impossible
to be a witness of and a contributor to the disruption of
the Army by the Soviet,&rdquo; was afterwards appointed to the Supreme
Command at the Front. Kerensky removed me from the office of
Chief-of-Staff of the Supreme C.-in-C. because I did not share the
views of the Government and openly disapproved of its activities,
but, at the same time, he allowed me to assume the high office
of Commander-in-Chief of our Western Front.</p>

<p>Things also happened of an entirely different nature. The
Supreme Commander-in-Chief, General Alexeiev, made several
unavailing efforts to dismiss Admiral Maximov, who had been
elected to the command of the Baltic Fleet and was entirely in the
hands of the mutinous Executive Committee of the Baltic Fleet.
It was necessary to remove that officer, who had brought about
so much evil, influenced, no doubt, by his surroundings, because
the Committee refused to release him, and Maximov refused all
summonses to come to the Stavka on the plea that the condition
of the Fleet was critical. In the beginning of June Brussilov
managed to remove him from the Fleet ... at the price of
appointing him Chief of the Naval Staff of the Supreme C.-in-C.
Many other examples might be quoted of incredible contrasts in
principles of Army Administration occasioned by the collision of
two opposing forces and two schools of thought.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I have already said that the entire Commanding Staff of
Generals was strictly loyal to the Provisional Government.
General Kornilov, the would-be &ldquo;rebel,&rdquo; addressed the following
speech to a Meeting of Officers: &ldquo;The old rÃ©gime has collapsed.
The people are building a new structure of liberty, and it is the
duty of the people&rsquo;s Army wholeheartedly to support the new
Government in its difficult, creative work.&rdquo; The Commanding
Staff may have taken some interest in questions of general policy
and in the Socialistic experiments of the Coalition Governments,
but no more than was taken by all cultured Russians, and they did
not consider themselves entitled or obliged to induce the troops
to participate in the solution of social problems. Their only concern
was to preserve the Army and the Foreign policy which
contributed to the victory. Such a connection between the Commanding
Staff and the Government, at first &ldquo;a love match&rdquo; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
later one of convenience, prevailed until the General Offensive in
June, while there still remained a flicker of hope that the mood of
the Army would change. That hope was destroyed by events,
and, after the advance, the attitude of the Commanding Staff was
somewhat shaken. I may add that the <i>entire</i> Senior Commanding
Staff considered as inadmissible the democratisation of the Army
which the Government was enforcing. From the table which I
have quoted it can be seen that 65 per cent. of the Commanding
Officers did not raise a sufficiently strong protest
against the disruption of the Army. The reasons were manifold
and entirely different. Some did it for tactical considerations,
as they thought that the Army was poisoned and that it should
be healed by such dangerous antidotes. Others were prompted
by purely selfish motives. I do not speak from hearsay, but
because I know the <i>milieu</i> and the individuals, many of whom
have discussed the matter with me with perfect frankness. Cultured
and experienced Generals could not frankly and scientifically
advocate such &ldquo;military&rdquo; views as, for example, Klembovski&rsquo;s
suggestion that a triumvirate should be placed at the head of the
Army, consisting of the Commander-in-Chief, a Commissar, and
an elected soldier; Kvietzinski&rsquo;s suggestion that the Army Committee
should be invested with special plenary power by the War
Minister and the Central Committee of the Soviet, which would
entitle them to act in the name of that Committee; or Viranovski&rsquo;s
suggestion that the entire Commanding Staff should be converted
into &ldquo;technical advisers&rdquo; and their power transferred entirely
to the Commissars and the Committee.</p>

<p>The loyalty of the High Commanding Staff can be gauged from
the following fact: At the end of April General Alexeiev, despairing
of the possibility of personally preventing the Government
from adopting measures which tended to disrupt the Army, and
before issuing the famous Proclamation of the Rights of the
Soldier, wired in cipher to all the Commanders-in-Chief a draft
of a strong and resolute collective appeal from the Army to the
Government. This appeal pointed to the abyss into which the
Army was being hurled. In the event of the draft being approved,
it was to have been signed by all Senior ranks, including
Divisional Commanders. The Fronts, however, for various
reasons, disapproved of such means of influencing the Government.
General Ragosa, the temporary C.-in-C. of the Roumanian
Front, who was afterwards Ukrainian War Minister under the
Hetman, replied that the Russian people seemed to be ordained
by the Almighty to perish, and it was therefore useless to struggle
against Fate. With a sign of the Cross, one should patiently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
await the dictates of Fate!... This was literally the sense
of his telegram.</p>

<p>Such was the attitude and the confusion in the higher ranks of
the Army. As regards the Commanders, who fought unremittingly
against the disruption of the Army, many of them struggled
against the tide of democratisation, as they considered it their duty
to the people. They did this in disregard of the success or failure
of their efforts, of the blows of Fate, or of the dark future, of
which some already had a premonition, and which was already
approaching with disaster in its train. On they went, with heads
erect, misunderstood, slandered and savagely hated, as long as
life and courage permitted.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII.</a></h2>

<p class="chapsummary"><span class="smcap">&ldquo;Democratisation of the Army&rdquo;&mdash;Administration, Service
and Routine.</span></p>

<p>In order to carry out the democratisation of the Army and
the reform of the War Ministry in accordance with the new
rÃ©gime, Gutchkov established a Commission under the Chairmanship
of the late War Minister, Polivanov, who died at Riga in
1920, where he was the expert of the Soviet Government in the
Delegation for making peace with Poland. The Commission was
composed of representatives of the Military Commission of the
Duma and of representatives of the Soviet. There was a similar
Commission in the Ministry of the Navy under the Chairmanship
of Savitch, a prominent member of the Duma. I know more
about the work of the First Commission, and will therefore dwell
upon it. The regulations drafted by the Commission were not
confirmed until they had been approved by the Military Section of
the Executive Committee of the Soviet, which enjoyed great
authority and often indulged in independent military law-making.
No future historian of the Russian Army will be able to avoid
mention of the Polivanov Commission&mdash;this fatal Institution
whose stamp is affixed to every one of the measures which
destroyed the Army. With incredible cynicism, not far removed
from treachery, this Institution, comprising many Generals and
officers appointed by the War Minister, systematically and daily
introduced pernicious ideas and destroyed the rational foundations
of military administration. Very often drafts of regulations,
which appeared to the Government as excessively demagogic and
were not sanctioned, appeared in the Press and came to the
knowledge of the masses of the soldiery. They were instilled into
the Army, and subsequently caused pressure to be brought to
bear upon the Government by the soldiery. The military members
of the Commission seemed to be competing with one another in
slavish subservience to the new masters, and endorsed by their
authority the destructive ideas. Men who reported to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
Committee have told me that civilians occasionally protested
during the debates and warned the Committee against going too
far, but no such protests ever came from the military members.
I fail to understand the psychology of the men, who came so
rapidly and unreservedly under the heel of the mob. The list of
military members of the Commission of the month of May
indicates that most of them were Staff Officers and representatives
of other Departments, mostly of Petrograd (twenty-five); only
nine were from the Army, and these do not seem to have been
drawn from the line. Petrograd has its own psychology different
from that of the Army. The most important and detrimental
Democratic regulations were passed concerning the organisation
of Committees, disciplinary action, the reform of the Military
Courts, and, finally, the famous &ldquo;Declaration of the Rights of
the Soldier.&rdquo;</p>

<p><i>Military Chiefs were deprived of disciplinary power.</i> It was
transferred to Regimental and Company Disciplinary Courts,
which also had to settle &ldquo;misunderstandings&rdquo; between officers and
men. There is no need to comment upon the importance of this
curtailment of the disciplinary power of the officers; it introduced
complete anarchy in the internal life of regimental units, and the
officer was discredited <i>by the law</i>. The latter circumstance is of
paramount importance, and the Revolutionary Democracy took
full advantage of this procedure in all its attempts at law-making.
The reform of the Courts aimed at weakening the influence of
military judges by appointment upon the course of the trial, the
introduction of juries and the general weakening of military
justice. Field Courts-Martial were abolished, which meted out
quick punishment on the spot for obvious and heavy crimes, such
as treason, desertion, etc.</p>

<p>The democratisation of the Military Courts might be excused
to a certain extent by the fact that confidence in the officers, having
been undermined, it was necessary to create judicial Courts of a
mixed composition on an elective basis, which in theory were
supposed to enjoy to a greater extent the confidence of the
Revolutionary Democracy. But that object was not attained,
because the Military Courts&mdash;one of the foundations of order in
the Army&mdash;fell entirely into the hands of the mob. The
investigating organs were completely destroyed by the
Revolutionary Democracy, and investigation was strongly
resisted by the armed men and sometimes by the Regimental
Revolutionary Institutions. The armed mob, which included
many criminal elements, exercised unrestrained and ignorant
pressure upon the conscience of the judges, and passed sentences<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
in advance of the verdicts of the judges. Army Corps Tribunals
were destroyed, and members of the jury who had dared to pass
a sentence distasteful to the mob were put to flight. These were
common occurrences. The case was heard in Kiev of the well-known
Bolshevik, Dzevaltovski, a captain of the Grenadier
Regiment of the Guards, who was accused, with seventy-eight
other men, of having refused to join in the advance and of having
dragged his regiment and other units to the rear. The circumstances
of the trial were these: In Court there was a mob of
armed soldiers, who shouted approval of the accused on his way
from the prison to the Court. Dzevaltovski called, together
with his escort, at the Local Soviet, where he received an ovation.
Finally, while the jury were deliberating, the Armed Reserve
Battalions paraded before the Court with the band and sang the
&ldquo;International.&rdquo; Dzevaltovski and all his companions were, of
course, found &ldquo;Not guilty.&rdquo; Military Courts were thus
gradually abolished.</p>

<p>It would be a mistake, however, to ascribe this new tendency
solely to the influence of the Soviets. It may also be explained
by Kerensky&rsquo;s point of view. He said: &ldquo;I think that no results
can be achieved by violence and by mechanical compulsion in
the present conditions of warfare, where huge masses are concerned.
The Provisional Government in the three months of its
existence has come to the conclusion that it is necessary to appeal
to the common-sense, the conscience and the sense of duty of the
citizens, and that it is the only means of achieving the desired
results.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the first days of the Revolution the Provisional Government
abolished Capital Punishment by the Ukase of March 12th. The
Liberal Press greeted this measure with great pathos. Articles
were written expressing strongly humanitarian views, but scant
understanding of realities, of the life of the Army, and also scant
foresight. V. Nabokoff, the Russian Abolitionist, who was General
Secretary to the Provisional Government, wrote: &ldquo;This happy
event is a sign of true magnanimity and of wise foresight....
Capital Punishment is abolished unconditionally and for
ever.... It is certain that in no other country has the moral
condemnation of this, the worst kind of murder, reached such
enormous proportions as in Russia.... Russia has joined
the States that no longer know the shame and degradation of
judicial murder.&rdquo; It is interesting to note that the Ministry of
Justice drafted two laws, in one of which Capital Punishment was
maintained for the most serious military offences&mdash;espionage and
treason. But the Department of Military Justice, headed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
General Anushkin, emphatically declared in favour of complete
abolition of Capital Punishment.</p>

<p>July came. Russia had already become used to Anarchist
outbreaks, but was nevertheless horror-stricken at the events that
took place on the battlefields of Galicia, near Kalush and Tarnopol.
The telegrams of the Government Commissars, Savinkov and
Filonenko, and of General Kornilov, who demanded the immediate
reintroduction of Capital Punishment, were as a stroke of a whip
to the &ldquo;Revolutionary Conscience.&rdquo; On July 11th, Kornilov
wrote: &ldquo;The Army of maddened, ignorant men, who are not
protected by the Government from systematic demoralisation and
disruption, and who have lost all sense of human dignity, is in full
flight. On the fields, which can no longer be called battlefields,
shame and horror such as the Russian Army has never known
reign supreme.... The mild Government measures have
destroyed discipline, and are provoking the fitful cruelty of the
unrestrained masses. These elemental feelings find expression
in violence, plunder and murders.... Capital Punishment
would save many innocent lives at the price of a few traitors and
cowards being eliminated.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On July 12th the Government restored Capital Punishment
and Revolutionary Military Tribunals, which replaced the former
Field Courts-Martial. The difference was that the judges were
elected (three officers and three men) from the list of the juries
or from Regimental Committees. This measure, the restoration
of Capital Punishment, due to pressure having been brought to
bear upon the Government by the Military Command, the Commissars,
and the Committees, was, however, foredoomed to
failure. Kerensky subsequently tried to apologise to the Democracy
at the &ldquo;Democratic Conference&rdquo;: &ldquo;Wait till I have
signed a single death sentence, and I will then allow you to curse
me....&rdquo; On the other hand, the very personnel of the Courts
and their surroundings, described above, made the very creation
of these Courts impossible: there were hardly any judges capable
of passing a death sentence or any Commissars willing to endorse
such a sentence. On the Fronts which I commanded there were,
at any rate, no such cases. After the new Revolutionary Military
Tribunals had been functioning for two months, the Department
of Military Justice was flooded with reports from Military Chiefs
and Commissars on the &ldquo;blatant infringements of judicial procedure,
upon the ignorance and lack of experience of the judges.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The disbandment of mutinous regiments was one of the punitive
measures carried out by the Supreme Administration or
Command. This measure had not been carefully thought out,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
and led to thoroughly unexpected consequences&mdash;it provoked
mutinies, prompted by a desire to be disbanded. Regimental
honour and other moral impulses had long since been characterised
as ridiculous prejudices. The actual advantages of disbanding,
on the other hand, were obvious to the men: regiments were
removed from the firing line for a long time, disbanding continued
for months, and the men were sent to new units, which were
thus filled with vagabond and criminal elements. Responsibility
for this measure can be equally divided between the War Ministry,
the Commissars, and the Stavka. The whole burden of it finally
fell once more upon the guiltless officers, who lost their regiments&mdash;which
were their families&mdash;and their appointments, and were
compelled to wander about in new places or find themselves in
the desolate condition of the Reserve.</p>

<p>Apart from this undesirable element, units were filled with
the late inmates of convict prisons, owing to the broad amnesty
granted by the Government to criminals, who were to expiate
their crimes by military service. My efforts to combat this
measure were unavailing, and resulted in the formation of a special
regiment of convicts&mdash;a present from Moscow&mdash;and in the formation
of solid anarchist cadres in the Reserve Battalions. The
<i>naÃ¯f</i> and insincere argument of the Legislator that crimes were
committed because of the Czarist RÃ©gime, and that a free country
would convert the criminal into a self-sacrificing hero, did not
come true. In the garrisons, where amnestied criminals were for
some reason or other more numerous, they became a menace to
the population before they ever saw the Front. Thus, in June,
in the units quartered at Tomsk, there was an intense propaganda
of wholesale plunder and of the suppression of all authority.
Soldiers formed large robber bands and terrorized the population.
The Commissar, the Chief of the garrison, and all the local
Revolutionary Organisations started a campaign against the plunderers;
after much fighting, no less than 2,300 amnestied criminals
were turned out of the garrison.</p>

<p>Reforms were intended to affect the entire administration of
the Army and of the Fleet, but the above-mentioned Committees
of Polivanov and Savitch failed to carry them out, as they were
abolished by Kerensky, who recognised at last all the evil they
had wrought. The Committees merely prepared the Democratisation
of the War and Naval Councils by introducing elected
soldiers into them. This circumstance is the more curious
because, according to the Legislator&rsquo;s intention, these Councils
were to consist of men of experience and knowledge, capable of
solving questions of organisation, service, and routine, of military<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
and naval legislation, and of making financial estimates of the cost
of the armed forces of Russia. This yearning of the uncultured
portion of Democracy for spheres of activity foreign to it was
subsequently developed on an extensive scale. Thus, for example,
many military colleges were, to a certain extent, managed by
Committees of servants, most of whom were illiterate. Under
the Bolshevik RÃ©gime, University Councils numbered not only
Professors and students, but also hall-porters.</p>

<p>I will not dwell upon the minor activities of the Committees,
the reorganisation of the Army, and the new regulations, but will
describe the most important measure&mdash;the Committees and the
&ldquo;Declaration of the Rights of the Soldier.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII.</a><br />
<span class="smcap">The Declaration of the Rights of the Soldier and Committees.</span></h2>

<p>Elective bodies from the Military Section of the Soviet to
Committees and Soviets of various denominations in regimental
units and in the Departments of the Army, the Fleet and
the rear, were the most prominent factor of &ldquo;Democratisation.&rdquo;
These institutions were partly of a mixed type, and included both
officers and men and partly soldiers and workers&rsquo; institutions pure
and simple. Committees and Soviets were formed everywhere
as the common feature of Revolutionary Organisations, planned
before the Revolution and sanctioned by the Order No. 1. Elections
from the troops to the Soviet in Petrograd were fixed for
February 27th, and the first Army Committees came into being
on March 1st, in consequence of the above-mentioned Order No. 1.
Towards the month of April self-appointed Soviets and Committees,
varying in denomination, personnel and ability, existed in
the Army and in the rear, and introduced incredible confusion
into the system of military hierarchy and administration. In
the first month of the Revolution the Government and the military
authorities did not endeavour to put an end to or to restrict this
dangerous phenomenon. They did not at first realise its possible
consequences, and counted upon the moderating influence of the
Officer element. They occasionally took advantage of the Committees
for counteracting acute manifestations of discontent
among the soldiers, as a doctor applies small doses of poison to
a diseased organism. The attitude of the Government and of the
military authorities towards these organisations was irresolute,
but was one of semi-recognition. On April 9th, addressing the
Army Delegates, Gutchkov said at Yassy: &ldquo;A Congress will
soon be held of the Delegates of all Army Organisations, and
general regulations will then be drawn up. Meanwhile, you
should <i>organise as best you can</i>, taking advantage of the existing
organisations and working for general unity.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span></p>

<p>In April the position became so complicated that the authorities
could no longer shirk the solution of the question of Committees.
At the end of March there was a Conference at the Stavka,
attended by the Supreme Commander-in-Chief, the War Minister,
Gutchkov, his Assistants, and officers of the General Staff. I was
also present in my capacity as future Chief-of-Staff to the Supreme
C.-in-C. A draft was presented to the Conference, brought from
Sevastopol by the Staff-Colonel Verkhovski (afterwards War
Minister). The draft was modelled upon the regulations already
in force in the Black Sea Fleet. The discussion amounted to the
expression of two extreme views&mdash;mine and those of Colonel
Verkhovski. The latter had already commenced those slightly
demagogic activities by which he had at first gained the sympathies
of the soldiers and of the sailors. He had had a short experience
in organising these masses. He was persuasive because he used
many illustrations&mdash;I do not know whether the facts he mentioned
were real or imaginary&mdash;his views were pliable, and his eloquence
was imposing. He idealised the Committees, and argued that
they were very useful, even necessary and statesmanlike, inasmuch
as they were capable of bringing order into the chaotic movements
of the soldiery. He emphatically insisted upon the competence
and the rights of these Committees being broadened.</p>

<p>I argued that the introduction of Committees was a measure
which the Army organisation would be unable to understand, and
that it amounted to disruption of the Army. If the Government
was unable to cope with the movement, it should endeavour to
paralyse its dangerous consequences. With that end in view, I
advocated that the activities of the Committees should be limited
to matters of internal organisation (food supplies, distribution of
equipment, etc.), that the officer element should be strengthened,
and that the Committees should remain within the sphere of the
lower grades of the Army, in order to prevent them from spreading
and acquiring a preponderating influence upon larger formations
such as Divisions, Armies, and Fronts. Unfortunately, I
only succeeded in compelling the Conference to accept my views
to an insignificant degree, and on March 30th the Supreme
C.-in-C. issued an Order of the Day on the &ldquo;transition to the
new forms of life,&rdquo; and appealing to the officers, men, and sailors
wholeheartedly to unite in the work of introducing strict order
and solid discipline within the units of the Army and Navy.</p>

<p>The main principles of the regulations were the following:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(1) The <i>fundamental objects</i> of the organisation were (<i>a</i>) to
increase the fighting power of the Army and of the Navy in order
to win the War; (<i>b</i>) to devise new rules for the life of the soldier-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>citizen
of Free Russia; and (<i>c</i>) to contribute to the education of
the Army and of the Fleet.</p>

<p>(2) The <i>structure</i> of the organisation: Permanent sections&mdash;Company,
Regimental, Divisional, and Army Committees. Temporary
sections&mdash;Conferences, attached to the Stavka, of Army
Corps, of the Fronts, and of the Centre. The latter to form
permanent Soviet.</p>

<p>(3) The Conferences to be called by the respective Commanding
Officers or on the initiative of the Army Committees. All the
resolutions of the Conferences and Committees to be confirmed
by the respective military authorities prior to publication.</p>

<p>(4) The <i>competence</i> of the Committees was limited to enforcing
order and fighting power (discipline, resistance to desertion, etc.),
routine (leave, barrack life, etc.), internal organisation (control
of food supplies and equipment), and education.</p>

<p>(5) <i>Questions of training</i> were unreservedly excluded from
discussion.</p>

<p>(6) The <i>personnel of the Committees</i> was determined in proportion
to elected representatives&mdash;one officer to two men.</p></blockquote>

<p>In order to give an idea of the slackening of discipline in the
higher ranks I may mention that, immediately after receiving
these regulations, and obviously under the influence of Army
organisations, General Brussilov issued the following order:
&ldquo;Officers to be excluded from Company Committees, and in
higher Committees the proportion lowered from one-third to
one-sixth....&rdquo;</p>

<p>In less than a fortnight, however, the War Ministry, in disregard
of the Stavka, published its own regulations, drafted by
the famous Polivanov Committee, with the assistance of Soviet
representatives. In these new regulations substantial alterations
were made: the percentage of officers in Committees was reduced;
Divisional Committees abolished; &ldquo;the taking of rightful
measures against abuses by Commanding Officers in the respective
units&rdquo; were added to the powers of the Committees; the
Company Committees were not permitted to discuss the matter of
military preparedness and other purely military matters affecting
the unit, but no such reservation was made with regard to Regimental
Committees; the Regimental Commanding Officer was
entitled to appeal against but not to suspend the decisions of the
Committee; finally, the Committees were given the task of negotiating
with political parties of every description in the matter of
sending delegates, speakers, and pamphlets explaining the political
programme before the elections to the Constituent Assembly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span></p>

<p>These regulations, which were tantamount to converting the
Army in war-time into an arena of political strife and depriving
the Commanding Officer of all control over his unit, constituted,
in fact, one of the main turning points on the path of destruction
of the Army.</p>

<p>The following appreciation of these regulations by the
Anarchist, Makhno (the Order of the Day of one of his subordinate
Commanders of November 10th, 1919), is worthy of note:
&ldquo;As any party propaganda at the present moment strongly
handicaps the purely military activities of the rebel armies, I
emphatically declare to the population that all party propaganda
is strictly prohibited pending the complete victory over the
White Armies....&rdquo;</p>

<p>Several days later, in view of a protest from the Stavka, the
War Ministry issued orders for the immediate suspension of the
regulations concerning the Committees. Where the Committees
had already been formed, they were allowed to carry on in order
to avoid misunderstandings. The Ministry decided to alter the
section of the regulations concerning the Committees, in
accordance with the orders of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief,
in which fuller consideration was given to the interests of the
troops. Thus, in the middle of April there was an infinite variety
in the organisation of the Army. Some institutions were illegal,
others were sanctioned by the Stavka, and others still by the
War Ministry. All these contradictions, changes, and re-elections
might have led to ridiculous confusion had not the Committees
simplified matters: they simply cast off all restrictions and acted
arbitrarily. Wherever troops or Army departments were
quartered among the population local Soldiers&rsquo; Soviets or Soviets
of Soldiers and Workmen were formed, which recognised no
regulations, and were particularly intent upon covering deserters
and mercilessly exploiting municipalities, Zemstvos, and the
population. The authorities never opposed them, and it was only
at the end of August that the War Ministry lost patience with the
abuses of these &ldquo;Institutions of the Rear,&rdquo; and informed the
Press that it <i>intended</i> to undertake the drafting of special
regulations concerning these Institutions.</p>

<p>Who were the members of the Committees? The combatant
element, living for and understanding the interests of the Army
and imbued with its traditions, was scantily represented. Valour,
courage and a sense of duty were rated very low on the market
of Soldiers&rsquo; Meetings. The masses of the soldiery, who were,
alas! ignorant, illiterate, and already demoralised and distrusted
their Chiefs, elected mostly men who imposed on them by smooth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
talking, purely external political knowledge derived from the
revelation of Party propaganda; chiefly, however, by shamelessly
bowing to the instincts of the men. How could a real soldier,
appealing to the sense of duty, to obedience and to a struggle for
the Mother Country, compete with such demagogues? The
officers did not enjoy the confidence, they did not wish to work
in the Committees, and their political education was probably
inadequate. In the Higher Committees one met honest and
sensible soldiers more often than officers, because a man wearing
a soldier&rsquo;s tunic was in a position to address the mob in a manner
in which the officer could never dare to indulge. The Russian
Army was henceforward administered by Committees formed of
elements foreign to the Army and representing rather Socialist
Party organs. It was strange and insulting to the Army that
Congresses of the Front, representing several million combatants
and many magnificent units with a long and glorious record, and
comprising officers and men of whom any Army might be proud,
were held under the Chairmanship of such men as civilian Jews
and Georgians, who were Bolsheviks, Mensheviks, or Social
Revolutionaries&mdash;Posner on the Western Front, Gegetchkory on
the Caucasian, and Doctor Lordkipanitze on the Roumanian.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>What, then, were these Army Organisations doing that were
supposed to reconstruct &ldquo;the freest Army in the world&rdquo;? I will
quote a list of questions discussed at Conferences of the Front and
which influenced the Front and Army Committees:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(1) The attitude towards the Government, the Soviet and the
Constituent Assembly.</p>

<p>(2) The attitude towards War and Peace.</p>

<p>(3) The question of a Democratic Republic as a desirable form
of Government.</p>

<p>(4) The question of the land.</p>

<p>(5) The Labour question.</p></blockquote>

<p>These intricate and burning political and social questions, to
which a radical solution was being given and which created
partisanship and class strife, were thus introduced into the Army
that was facing a strong and cruel enemy. The effect was self-evident.
But even in strictly military matters certain utterances
were made at the Conference at Minsk, which attracted the
particular attention of the military and civil authorities, and caused
us gravely to ponder. It was suggested that the rank of officer,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
individual disciplinary power, etc., should be abolished, and that
the Committees should be entitled to remove Commanding Officers
of whom they disapproved. From the very first days of their
existence the Committees fought stubbornly to obtain full power
not only with regard to the administration of the Army, but
even for the formula: &ldquo;All Power to the Soviets.&rdquo; At first,
however, the attitude of the Army Committees towards the
Provisional Government was perfectly loyal, and the lower the
Committee the more loyal it was. The Petrograd papers of
March 17th were full of resolutions proclaiming unrestricted
obedience to the Provisional Government, of telegrams greeting
and of records of delegations sent by the troops, who were
perturbed by rumours of the opposition of the Soviet. This
attitude later underwent several changes, due to the propaganda
of the Soviet. A powerful influence was exercised by the
resolution of the Congress of Soviets, which I have already
quoted, and which appealed to the Russian Revolutionary
Democracy to organise under the guidance of the Soviets and
to be prepared to resist all the attempts of the Government to
avoid the control of the Democracy or the fulfilment of their
pledges.</p>

<p>The Higher Committees indulged chiefly in political activities
and in the strengthening of Revolutionary tendencies in the Army,
while the Lower Committees gradually became absorbed in
matters of service and routine, and were weakening and
discrediting the authority of the Commanding Officers. The right
to remove these officers was practically established, because the
position of those who had received a vote of censure became
intolerable. Thus, for instance, on the Western Front, which I
commanded, about sixty Senior Officers resigned&mdash;from Army
Corps to Regimental Commanders. What was, however,
infinitely more tragic was the endeavour of the Committees, on
their own initiative and under pressure from the troops, to interfere
with purely military and technical Orders, thus rendering
military operations difficult or even impossible. The Commanding
Officer who was discredited, fettered and deprived of power, and,
therefore, of responsibility, could no longer confidently lead the
troops into the field of victory and death.... As there was
no authority the Commanding Officers were compelled to have
recourse to the Committees, which sometimes did exercise a
restraining influence over the licentious soldiery, resisted
desertion, smoothed friction between officers and men, appealed
to the latter&rsquo;s sense of duty&mdash;in a word, tried to arrest the
collapse of the crumbling structure. These activities of some of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
the Committees still misled their apologists, including Kerensky.
It is no use to argue with men who think that a structure may be
erected by one laying bricks one day and pulling them to pieces
on the next.</p>

<p>The work, overt and unseen, of Army Committees, alternating
between patriotic appeals and internationalist watchwords,
between giving assistance to Commanding Officers and dismissing
them, between expressions of confidence in, or of distrust of, the
Provisional Government, and ultimatums for new boots or
travelling allowances for members of Committees.... The
historian of the Russian Army, in studying these phenomena, will
be amazed at the ignorance of the elementary rules governing the
very existence of an armed force, which was displayed by the
Committees in their decisions and in their writings.</p>

<p>The Committees of the Rear and of the Fleet were imbued
with a particularly demagogic spirit. The Baltic Fleet was in a
state approaching anarchy all the time; the Black Sea Fleet was
in a better condition, and held out until June. It is difficult to
estimate the mischief made by these Committees and Soviets in
the Rear, scattered all over the country. Their overbearing
manner was only comparable with their ignorance. I will
mention a few examples illustrating these activities.</p>

<p>The Regional Committee of the Army, the Fleet and the
Workmen of Finland issued a declaration in May, in which, not
content with the autonomy granted to Finland by the Provisional
Government, they demanded her complete independence, and
declared that &ldquo;they would give every support to all the
Revolutionary Organisations working for a speedy solution of
that question.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Central Committee of the Baltic Fleet, in conjunction with
the above-mentioned Committee, made a declaration, which coincided
with the Bolshevik outbreak in Petrograd in the beginning of
June. They demanded &ldquo;all power to the Soviets. We shall
unite in the Revolutionary struggle of our working Democracy
for power, and will not allow the ships to be called out by the
Provisional Government for the suppression of the mutiny to
leave Petrograd.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Committee of the Minsk Military District, shortly before
the advance, gave leave to all the Reservists to proceed to their
farms. I gave orders for the trial of the Committee, but the
order was of no avail, because, in spite of all my representations,
the War Ministry had not established any legal responsibility for
the Committees, whose decisions were recorded by vote and occasionally
by secret ballot. I will mention yet another curious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
episode. The Committee of one of the Cavalry DepÃ´ts on my
Front decided that horses should be watered only once a day, so
most of the horses were lost.</p>

<p>It would be unjust to deny that the organisations of the Rear
occasionally did adopt reasonable measures, but these instances
are few indeed, and they were drowned in the general wave of
anarchy which these organisations had raised. The attitude of
the Committees towards the War, and in particular towards the
proposed advance, was, of course, a momentous matter. In
Chapter X. I have already described the self-contradictions of the
Soviets and Congresses, as well as the ambiguous and insincere
directions which they gave to the Army Organisations, and which
amounted to the acceptance of War and of the advance, but without
victory. The same ambiguity prevailed in the High Committees,
with the exception, however, of the Committee of our
Western Front, which passed in June a truly Bolshevik Resolution
to the effect that War has been engendered by the plundering
policy of the Government; that the only means of ending the War
was for the united Democracies of all countries to resist their
Governments; and that a decisive victory of one or the other of
the contending groups of Powers would only tend to increase
militarism at the expense of Democracy.</p>

<p>As long as the Front was quiet the troops accepted all these discourses
and Resolutions in a spirit of comparative indifference.
But when the time came for the advance, many people thought of
saving their skins, and the ready formulas of Defeatism proved
opportune. Besides the Committees, who were continuing to pass
patriotic Resolutions, certain organisations reflecting the views
of the units of the Army, or their own, violently opposed the idea
of an advance. Entire regiments, divisions, and even Army Corps,
especially on the Northern and Western Russian Fronts, refused
to conduct preparatory work or to advance to the firing line. On
the eve of the advance we had to send large forces for the suppression
of units that had treacherously forgotten their duty.</p>

<p>I have already mentioned the attitude of many Senior Commanders
towards the Committees. The best summary of these
views can be found in the appeal of General Fedotov, in temporary
command of an Army, to the Army Committee: &ldquo;Our Army is
at present organised as no other Army in the world....
Elected bodies play an important part. We&mdash;<i>the former leaders</i>&mdash;can
only give the Army our military knowledge of strategy and
tactics. You&mdash;the Committees&mdash;are called upon to organise the
Army and to create its internal strength. Great indeed is the
part which you&mdash;the Committees&mdash;are called upon to play in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
creation of a new and strong Army. History will recognise
this....&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before the Army Organisations were sanctioned the Commander
of the Caucasian Front issued an Order for the decisions
of the self-appointed Tiflis Soldiers&rsquo; Soviet to be published in the
Orders of the Day, and for all regulations appertaining to the
Organisation and routine of the Army to be sanctioned by that
Soviet. Is one to wonder that such an attitude of a certain portion
of the Commanding Staffs gave an excuse and a foundation
for the growing demands of the Committees?</p>

<p>As regards the Western and South-Western Fronts, which I
commanded, I definitely refused to have anything to do with the
Committees, and suppressed, whenever possible, such of their
activities as were contrary to the interests of the Army. One of
the prominent Commissars, a late member of the Executive Committee
of the Soviet, Stankevitch, wrote: &ldquo;Theoretically, it
became increasingly apparent that either the Army must be
abolished or else the Committees. In practice, one could do
neither one nor the other. The Committees were a vivid
expression of the incurable sociological disease of the Army, and
a sign of its certain collapse and paralysis. Was it not for the
War Ministry to hasten the death by a resolute and hopeless
surgical operation?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The once great Russian Army of the first period of the Revolution
dwindled inevitably to nothing under such conditions as
these:</p>

<p>There was no Mother Country. The leader had been crucified.
In his stead a group appeared at the Front of five Defensists and
three Bolsheviks, and made an appeal to the Army:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forward, to battle for liberty and for the Revolution, but
... without inflicting a decisive defeat upon the enemy,&rdquo;
cried the former.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Down with the War and all power to the Proletariat!&rdquo;
shouted the others.</p>

<p>The Army listened and listened, but would not move. And
then ... it dispersed!</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX.</a><br />
<span class="smcap">The Democratisation of the Army: The Commissars.</span></h2>

<p>The next measure for the democratisation of the Army was
the introduction of the Institution of Commissars. The
idea was derived from the history of the French Revolutionary
Wars, and was fostered in various circles at different times; it
was prompted chiefly by <i>distrust of the Commanding Staffs</i>.
Pressure was brought to bear from below. The Conference of
the Delegates of the Front addressed an emphatic demand to the
Soviet in the middle of April that Commissars should be introduced
in the Army. The excuse was that it was no longer possible
to preserve order in respect of the attitude of the men towards
individual Commanding Officers, and that, if cases of arbitrary
dismissal had as yet been avoided, it was only due to the fact that
the Army expected the Soviet and the Government to take the
necessary steps and did not wish to handicap their work. At the
same time, the Conference suggested the absurd idea of the
simultaneous appointment to the Army of three kinds of Commissars:
(1) from the Provisional Government, (2) from the
Soviets, and (3) from the Army Committees. The Conference
went very far in their demands, and demanded that the Commissariats,
as controlling organs, should: discuss <i>all</i> matters appertaining
to the competence of the Commanders of Armies and
Fronts; counter-sign <i>all</i> Army Orders; investigate the activities
of the Commanding Staffs, with the right to recommend their
dismissal.</p>

<p>Protracted negotiations on this matter ensued between the
Soviet and the Government, and at the end of April it was agreed
that Commissars would be appointed to the Army&mdash;one from the
Provisional Government and one from the Soviet. This decision,
however, was subsequently altered, probably as the result of the
formation of a Coalition Ministry (May 5th). One Commissar
was appointed by agreement between the Government and the
Soviet. He represented both these bodies, and was responsible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
to them. At the end of June the Provisional Government introduced
the office of Commissar of the Fronts, and thus defined their
function: according to the instructions of the War Ministry, they
were to see that all political questions arising within the Armies
of the Front should be given a uniform solution, and that the work
of the Army Commissars should be co-ordinated. At the end of
July a final touch was given by the appointment of a High Commissar
attached to the Stavka, and the entire official correspondence
was concentrated in the political section of the War
Ministry. No law, however, was passed defining the rights and
the duties of the Commissars. The Commanding Staffs, at any
rate, were unaware of such laws, and this alone gave rise to all
the misunderstandings and conflicts that followed. The Commissars
had secret instructions to watch the Commanding Staffs
and Headquarters in respect of their political reliability. From
that point of view the democratic rÃ©gime went further, perhaps,
than the autocratic. Of this I became convinced during my
command of the Western and South-Western Fronts, in reading
the telegrams exchanged between the Commissariats and Petrograd.
These telegrams&mdash;may the Commissars forgive me!&mdash;were
handed to me, de-coded, by my Staff, immediately after their
despatch. This part of the Commissars&rsquo; duty required a certain
training in political intelligence, but their overt duties were infinitely
more complex: they demanded statesmanship, a clear
knowledge of the aims to be pursued, an understanding of the
psychology, not merely of the officers and men, but of the Senior
Commanding Staff, acquaintance with the fundamental principles
of service and routine in the Army, great tact, and, finally, the
personal qualities of courage, strong will, and energy. Only such
qualifications were capable of mitigating to a certain degree the
disastrous consequences of a measure which deprived (to be more
accurate, sanctioned the deprivation of) the Commanding
Officers of the possibility of influencing the troops&mdash;that influence
being the only means of strengthening the hope and faith in
victory.</p>

<p>Such elements were not to be found, unfortunately, in the
circles connected with the Government and the Soviet and enjoying
their confidence. The personnel of the Commissars whom I
met may be described thus: War-time officers, doctors, solicitors,
newspaper men, exiles and <i>emigrÃ©s</i> completely out of touch with
Russian life, members of militant Revolutionary organisations,
etc. These men had, obviously, inadequate knowledge of the
Army. All these men belonged to Socialist parties, from Social-Democrat
Mensheviks to the group &ldquo;Edinstvo&rdquo; (unity), War<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
party blinkers, and very often did not follow the political lines of
the Government because they considered themselves tied by
Soviet and party discipline. Owing to political differences of
opinion, the attitude of the Commissars towards the War also
varied. Stankevitch, one of the Commissars, who carried out
his duties in his own way most conscientiously, when proceeding
to visit an advancing Division was beset with doubts: &ldquo;The
soldiers believe that we do not wish to deceive them; they force
themselves, therefore, to forget their doubts, and they go forward
to death and murder. But we, are we entitled not only to
encourage them, but to take upon ourselves the decision?&rdquo;
According to Savinkov (who was Commissar of the Seventh Army
of the South-Western Front, and later War Minister), not all the
Commissars agreed upon the question of Bolshevism, and not all
of them considered a resolute struggle against the Bolsheviks
possible or desirable. Savinkov was an exception. Although not
a soldier by profession, he was steeled in struggle and wanderings,
in constant danger, and his hands were stained with the
blood of political victims. This man, however, understood the
laws of the struggle, threw off the yoke of the party, and fought
more resolutely than others against the disorganisation of the
Army. But the personal touch in his attitude towards the events
was somewhat too marked. None of the Commissars, with the
exception of very few men of the Savinkov type, displayed personal
strength or energy. They were men of words, not of deeds.
Their lack of training would not have had such negative results
had it not been for the fact that, their functions not being clearly
defined, they gradually began to interfere with every feature of
the life and service of the troops, partly on their own initiative,
partly at the instigation of the men and of the Army Committees,
and partly even of Commanding Officers, who were trying to
escape responsibility. Questions of appointments, dismissals, and
even operative plans attracted the attention of the Commissars,
not only from the point of view of &ldquo;covert counter-Revolution,&rdquo;
but from the point of view of practicability. The confusion in
their minds was so great that the weaker elements among the
Commanding Staffs were sometimes completely disheartened. I
remember one case during the July retreat on the South-Western
Front. One of the Army Corps Commanders rashly destroyed a
well-equipped military railway, thereby placing the Army in an
exceedingly difficult position. He was dismissed by the Army
Commander, and afterwards expressed to me his sincere astonishment:
&ldquo;Why had he been dismissed? He had acted&mdash;upon the
instructions of the Commissar.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span></p>

<p>The Commissars carried out the ideas of the Soviet and whole-heartedly
defended the sacred newly-acquired rights of the soldier,
but failed to fulfil their primary duty&mdash;direct the political life of
the Army. Very often the most destructive propaganda was
permitted. Soldiers&rsquo; meetings and Committees were allowed to
pass all kinds of anti-National and anti-Government resolutions,
and the Commissars only interfered when the tension of the
atmosphere resulted in an armed mutiny. Such a policy puzzled
the troops, the Committees, and the Commanding Officers.</p>

<p>The institution of Commissars did not attain its purpose.
Among the soldiers the Commissars could not be popular because
they were to a certain extent an instrument of compulsion, and
occasionally of suppression. At the same time, the extent of their
power was not well defined, and they could not gain proper
authority over the most undisciplined units. This was confirmed
later after the seizure of power by the Bolsheviks, when the
Commissars were the first to flee from their posts in a great hurry
and in secret.</p>

<p>There thus appeared in the Russian Army, instead of one
authority, three different authorities, which excluded one another&mdash;the
Commanding Officer, the Committee, and the Commissar.
They were shadowy authorities. Another authority was overhanging,
and was oppressing them morally with all its insensate
weight&mdash;the power of the mob.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In examining the question of the new Institutions&mdash;Commissars
and Committees&mdash;and of their bearing upon the destinies of the
Russian Army, I have done so solely from the point of view of the
preservation of our Armed Forces as an important factor in the
future of our country. It would, however, be a mistake to overlook
the connection between these measures and the entirety of
laws which govern the life of the people and the course of the
Revolution. These measures, moreover, bear the stamp of logic
and of inevitability owing to the part which the Revolutionary
Democracy had chosen to play. Therein lies the tragedy of the
situation. The Socialist Democracy did not possess any elements
sufficiently trained to become the instruments of Army
Administration. At the same time, it did not have the courage
or the possibility to quell the resistance of the Bourgeois
Democracy and of the Commanding Staffs, and to compel them
to work for the glorification of Socialism, as the Bolsheviks
afterwards did, who forced the remnants of the Russian
<i>intelligencia</i> and of the officers to serve Communism by applying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
methods of sanguinary and ruthless extermination. When the
Revolutionary Democracy actually assumed power and set up to
fulfil certain aims it was well aware of the fact that those elements
in the administration and the Command who were called upon to
carry out these aims did not share the views of the Revolutionary
Democracy. Hence the inevitable distrust of these elements and
the desire to weaken their influence and their authority. What
methods did the Democracy have recourse to? As the Central
Revolutionary organ was utterly devoid of statesmanship and of
patriotism, it applied in its struggle against political opponents
destructive methods, completely disregarding the fact that by these
methods they were destroying the country and the Army. Another
circumstance must be borne in mind&mdash;the Revolution that had
shaken the State to its very foundations and upset the established
class relations occurred at the moment when the flower of the
Nation&mdash;over 10,000,000 men&mdash;were under arms. Elections to the
Constituent Assembly were impending. In these circumstances
it was impossible to avoid politics being introduced into the Army,
as it is impossible to arrest the course of a river. But it would
have been possible to divert it to proper channels. In this matter,
however, the two contending forces (that which wished to preserve
the State and the Demagogic Force) also collided, as both
endeavoured to influence the attitude of the Army, which was a
decisive factor in the Revolution.</p>

<p>These were the propositions which pre-ordained and explained
the subsequent course of the Democratisation of the Army. The
Socialist Democracy, which governed at first behind the scenes
and then overtly, was endeavouring to strengthen its position and
to bow to the instincts of the crowd, destroyed the military power
and connived at the Institution of Elective Military Organisations,
which were less dangerous and more open to its influence than
the Commanding Staffs, although they did not answer the
requirements of the Soviet. The necessity of military authority
of some sort was clearly realised. The Commanding Staffs were
distrusted, and there was a desire to create a buffer between the
two artificially separated elements of the Army. These considerations
inspired the creation of the office of Commissars, who
bore the dual responsibility before the Soviet and the Government.
Neither the men nor the officers were satisfied with these
institutions, which fell together with the Provisional Government,
were revived with certain modifications in the Red Army, and once
again swept away by the tide of events.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Peoples cannot choose their Institutions, as man cannot
choose his age. Peoples obey the Institutions to which they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
tied by their past, their creed, by the economic laws and
surroundings in which they live. There are many examples in
history when the people have destroyed by violent Revolution
the Institutions which it has taken a dislike for. But there is not
a case in history of these new institutions forcibly imposed upon
the people becoming permanent and solid. After a while the
past comes again into force, because we are created entirely by
that past and it is our supreme ruler.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>It is obvious that the Russian National Army will be revived
not only on democratic, but on historical foundations.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX.</a></h2>

<p class="chapsummary"><span class="smcap">The Democratisation of the Army&mdash;The Story of &ldquo;The
Declaration of the Rights of the Soldier.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>The ill-famed law, emanating from the Polivanov Committee
and known as the &ldquo;Declaration of the Rights of the
Soldier,&rdquo; was confirmed by Kerensky on May 9th. I will give
the main points of that law:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(1) &ldquo;All soldiers of the Army enjoy full rights of citizenship.&rdquo;</p>

<p>(2) Every soldier is entitled to the membership of any political,
national, religious, economic, or professional organisation,
society or union.</p>

<p>(3) Every soldier off duty has the right freely and openly to
express in word, writing, or in the Press his political, religious,
social and other views.</p>

<p>(4) All printed matter (periodicals and other) should be
delivered to the addressees.</p>

<p>(5) Soldiers are not to be appointed as orderlies. Officers are
entitled to have one servant, appointed by mutual consent (of the
soldier and of the officer); wages also to be settled by mutual
consent, but there should be no more than one servant to each
officer, Army doctor, Army clerk, or Priest.</p>

<p>(6) Saluting is abolished for men as well as for units.</p>

<p>(7) No soldier is to be punished or fined without trial. At the
Front the Commanding Officer is entitled, on his own responsibility,
to take the necessary steps, including armed force, against
disobedient subordinates. Such steps are not to be considered
as disciplinary punishments. Internal administration, punishments,
and control in cases defined by Army regulations, belong
to elective Army Organisations.</p></blockquote>

<p>This &ldquo;Declaration of Rights,&rdquo; of which the above is but a
brief summary, gave official sanction to the malady with which
the Army was stricken, and which spread in varying degrees owing
to mutinies, violence, and &ldquo;by Revolutionary methods,&rdquo; as the
current expression goes. It dealt a death-blow to the old Army.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
It introduced boundless political discussions and social strife into
the unbalanced <span class="small">ARMED MASSES</span> which had already become aware of
their rough physical power. &ldquo;The Declaration&rdquo; admitted and
sanctioned wide propaganda by speech and pamphlet of anti-national,
immoral and anti-Social doctrines, and even the doctrines
that repudiated the State and the very existence of the Army.
Finally, it deprived Commanding Officers of disciplinary power,
which was handed over to elective bodies, and once again insulted
and degraded the Commanding Staff. In his remarks attached
to the text of the &ldquo;Declaration,&rdquo; Kerensky says: &ldquo;Let the freest
Army and Navy of the World prove that there is strength and
not weakness in Liberty, let them forge a new iron discipline of
duty and raise the Armed Power of the country.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the &ldquo;Great Silent One,&rdquo; as the French picturesquely
describe the Army, began to talk and to shout louder and louder
still, enforcing its demands by threats, by arms, and by shedding
the blood of those who dared to resist its folly.</p>

<p>At the end of April the final draft of the &ldquo;Declaration&rdquo; was
sent by Gutchkov to the Stavka for approval. The Supreme
Commander-in-Chief and myself returned an emphatic disapproval,
in which we gave vent to all our moral sufferings and our grief
for the dark future of the Army. Our conclusion was that the
&ldquo;Declaration&rdquo; &ldquo;was the last nail driven into the coffin which
has been prepared for the Russian Army.&rdquo; On May 1st
Gutchkov resigned from the War Ministry, as he did not wish
&ldquo;to share the responsibility for the heavy sin which was committed
against the Mother Country,&rdquo; and in particular to sign the
&ldquo;Declaration.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Stavka sent copies of the draft &ldquo;Declaration&rdquo; to the
Commander-in-Chief of the Fronts for reference, and they were
called by General Alexeiev to Moghilev, in order to discuss the
fateful position. This historical Conference took place on
May 2nd. The speeches, in which the collapse of the Russian
Army was described, were restrained and yet moving, as they
reflected deep sorrow and apprehension. Brussilov, in a low
voice expressing sincere and unfeigned pain, ended thus: &ldquo;All
this can yet be borne, and there still remains some hope of saving
the Army and leading it forward, provided the &lsquo;Declaration&rsquo; is
not issued. If it is, there is no salvation, and I would not remain
in office for a single day.&rdquo; This last sentence provoked a warm
protest from General Stcherbatchov, who argued that no one
should resign, that, however arduous and hopeless the position<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
may be, the leaders cannot abandon the Army.... Somebody
suggested that all the Commanders-in-Chief should immediately
proceed to Petrograd, and address to the Provisional
Government a stern warning and definite demands. The General
who suggested this thought that such a demonstration would
produce a very strong impression and might arrest the progress
of destructive legislation. Others thought that it was a dangerous
expedient and our last trump card, and that, should the step prove
ineffective, the High Command would be definitely discredited.
The suggestion, however, was accepted, and, on the 4th May, a
Conference took place of all the Commanders-in-Chief (with the
exception of the Caucasian Front), the Provisional Government,
and the Executive Committee of the Soviet. I am in possession
of the record of that Conference, of which I give extensive extracts
below. The condition of the Army, such as it appeared to its
leaders, in the course of events, and without, therefore, any
historical perspective, is therein described, as well as the characteristics
of the men who were then in power. The trend of the
speeches made by the Commander-in-Chief was the same as in
the Stavka, but they were less emphatic and less sincere. Brussilov
smoothed over his accusations, lost his pathos, &ldquo;warmly greeted
the Coalition Ministry,&rdquo; and did not repeat his threat of
resignation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Record.</span></p>

<p><i>General Alexeiev.</i>&mdash;I consider it necessary to speak quite
frankly. We are all united in wishing for the good of our
country. Our paths may differ, but we have a common goal of
ending the War in such a manner as to allow Russia to come out
of it unbroken, albeit tired and suffering. Only victory can give
us the desired consummation. Only then will creative work be
possible. But victory must be achieved, and that is only possible
if the orders of the Commanding Officers are obeyed. If not, it
is not an Army, but a mob. To sit in the trenches does not mean
to reach the end of the War. The enemy is transferring, in great
haste, division after division from our Front to the Franco-British
Front, and we continue to sit still. Meanwhile, the conditions are
most favourable for our victory, but we must advance in order to
win it. Our Allies are losing faith in us. We must reckon with
this in the diplomatic sphere, and I particularly in the military
one. It seemed as if the Revolution would raise our spirits, would
give us impetus, and therefore victory. In that, unfortunately,
we have so far been mistaken. Not only is there no enthusiasm
or impetus, but the lowest instincts have come to the fore, such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
as self-preservation. The interests of the Mother Country and its
future are not being considered.... You will ask what has
happened to the authority, to principles, or even to physical compulsion?
I am bound to state that the reforms to which the Army
has as yet failed to adapt itself have shaken it, have undermined
order and discipline. Discipline is the mainstay of the Army. If
we follow that path any further there will be a complete collapse....
The Commanders-in-Chief will give you a series of facts
describing the condition of the Armies. I will offer a conclusion
and will give expression to our desires and demands, which must
be complied with.</p>

<p><i>General Brussilov.</i>&mdash;I must first of all describe to you the
present condition of the officers and men. Cavalry, artillery and
engineering troops have retained about 50 per cent. of their cadres.
But in the infantry, which is the mainstay of the Army, the position
is entirely different. Owing to enormous casualties in killed,
wounded and prisoners, as well as many deserters, some regiments
have changed their cadres nine or ten times, so that only from
three to ten men remain of the original formation. Reinforcements
are badly trained and their discipline is still worse. Of the
regular officers from two to four remain and in many cases they
are wounded. Other officers are youngsters commissioned after
a short training and enjoying no authority owing to their lack of
experience. It is upon these new cadres that the task has fallen
to remodel the Army on a new basis, and that task has so far
proved beyond their capacity. Although we felt that a change was
necessary and that it had already come too late, the ground was
nevertheless unprepared. The uneducated soldier understood it as
a deliverance from the officers&rsquo; yoke. The officers greeted the
change with enthusiasm. Had this not been so, the Revolution
may not have probably passed so smoothly. The result, however,
was that freedom was only given to the men, whereas the officers
had to be content to play the part of pariahs of liberty. The
unconscious masses were intoxicated with liberty. Everyone
knows that extensive rights have been granted, but they do not
know what these rights are, and nobody bothers about duties.
The position of the officers is very difficult. From 15 to 20 per
cent. have rapidly adapted themselves to the new conditions,
because they believed that these conditions were all to the good.
Those of the officers who were trusted by the men did not lose
that trust. Some, however, became too familiar with the men,
were too lenient and even encouraged internal dissensions amongst
the men. But the majority of the officers, about 75 per cent., were
unable to adapt themselves. They were offended, retired to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
background and do not know what to do now. We are trying
to bring them into contact with the soldiers once more, because
we need the officers for continued fighting, and we have no other
cadres. Many of the officers have no political training, do not
know how to make speeches&mdash;and this, of course, handicaps the
work of mutual understanding. It is necessary to explain and to
instil into the masses the idea that freedom has been granted to
<i>everyone</i>. I have known our soldiers for forty-five years, I love
them and I will do my best to bring them into close touch with the
officers, but the Provisional Government, the Duma and particularly
the Soviet should also make every effort in order to assist in that
work which must be done as soon as possible in the interests of
the country. It is also necessary, owing to the peculiar fashion
in which the illiterate masses have understood the watchword
&ldquo;without annexations and indemnities.&rdquo; One of the regiments
has declared that not only would it refuse to advance, but desired
to leave the front and to go home. The Committees opposed
this tendency, but were told that they would be dismissed. I had
a lengthy argument with the regiment, and when I asked the men
whether they agreed with me, they begged leave to give me a
written answer. A few minutes later they presented to me a
poster: &ldquo;Peace at any price and down with the War.&rdquo; In the
course of a subsequent talk I had with one of the men, he said
to me: &ldquo;If there are to be no annexations, why do we want that
hill top?&rdquo; My reply was: &ldquo;I also do not want the hill top, but
we must beat the enemy who is occupying it.&rdquo; Finally, the men
promised to hold on, but refused to advance, arguing that &ldquo;the
enemy is good to us and has informed us that he will not advance
provided we do not move. It is important that we should go home
to enjoy freedom and the land. Why should we allow ourselves
to be maimed?&rdquo; Is it to be an offensive or a defensive campaign?
Success can be only obtained by an offensive. If we conduct a
passive defence the front is bound to be broken. If discipline is
strong a break-through may yet be remedied. But we must not
forget that we have no well-disciplined troops, that they are badly
trained and that the officers have no authority. In these circumstances
an enemy success may easily become a catastrophe. The
masses must, therefore, be persuaded that we must advance instead
of remaining on the defensive.</p>

<p>We thus have many shortcomings, but numerical superiority is
still on our side. If the enemy succeeds in breaking the French
and the British, he will throw his entire weight upon us and we
will then be lost. We need a strong government upon which we
could rely, and we whole-heartedly greet the coalition govern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>ment.
The power of the State can only be strong when it leans
upon the Army, which represents the armed forces of the nation.</p>

<p><i>General Dragomirov.</i>&mdash;The prevailing spirit in the Army is
the desire of peace. Anyone might be popular in the Army who
would preach peace without annexations and would advocate self-determination.
The illiterate masses have understood the idea of
&ldquo;no annexations&rdquo; in a peculiar fashion. They do not understand
the conditions of different peoples, and they repeatedly ask the
question: &ldquo;Why do not the Allied democracies join in our
declarations?&rdquo; The desire for peace is so strong that reinforcements
refuse to accept equipment and arms and say: &ldquo;They are
no good to us as we do not intend to fight.&rdquo; Work has come to
a standstill and it is even necessary to see to it that trenches are
not dismantled and that roads are mended. In one of the best
regiments we found, on the sector which it had occupied, a red
banner inscribed: &ldquo;Peace at all costs.&rdquo; The officer who tore that
banner had to flee for his life. During the night men from that
regiment were searching for the officer at Dvinsk, as he had
been concealed by the Headquarters Staff. The dreadful expression
&ldquo;Adherents of the old rÃ©gime&rdquo; caused the best officers to
be cast out of the Army. We all wanted a change, and yet many
excellent officers, the pride of the Army, had to join the Reserve
simply because they tried to prevent the disruption of the Army,
but failed to adapt themselves to the new conditions. What is
much more fatal is the growth of slackness and of a lingering
spirit. Egoism is reaching terrible proportions, and each unit
thinks only of its own welfare; endless deputations come to us
daily, demanding to be relieved, to remove Commanding Officers,
to be re-equipped, etc. All these deputations have to be addressed,
and this hinders our work. Orders that used to be implicitly
obeyed now demand lengthy arguments; if a battery is moved to
a different sector, there is immediate discontent, and the men say:
&ldquo;You are weakening us&mdash;you are traitors.&rdquo; Owing to the weakness
of the Baltic Fleet, we found it necessary to send an Army
Corps to the rear to meet the eventual landing of an enemy force,
but we were unable to do so, because the men said: &ldquo;Our line
is long enough as it is and if we lengthen it still more we will be
unable to hold the enemy.&rdquo; Formerly we had no difficulty whatsoever
in regrouping the troops. In September, 1915, eleven
Army Corps were removed from the Western front, and this saved
us from a defeat which might have decided the fate of the War.
At present such a thing would be impossible, as every unit raises
objections to the slightest move. It is very difficult to compel the
men to do anything in the interests of the Mother Country. Regi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>ments
refuse to relieve their comrades in the firing line under
various excuses&mdash;such as bad weather, or the fact that not all their
men had had their baths. On one occasion a unit refused to go
to the front on the plea that it had already been in the firing line
at Easter time. We are compelled to ask the Committees of various
regiments to argue the matter out. Only a small minority of
officers is behaving in an undignified manner, trying to make
themselves popular by bowing to the instincts of the men. The
system of elections has not been introduced in its entirety, but
many unpopular officers have been summarily dismissed as they
were accused of being adherents to the old rÃ©gime; other Commanding
Officers, who had been considered incompetent and liable
to dismissal, have been made to stay. It was quite impossible not
to grant the demands for their retention. With regard to excesses
there have been individual cases of shootings of officers....
Things cannot continue on these lines. We want strong power.
We have fought for the country. You have taken the ground
from under our feet. Will you kindly restore it? Our obligations
are colossal, and we must have the power in order to be able to
lead to victory the millions of soldiers who are entrusted to our
care.</p>

<p><i>General Stcherbatchov.</i>&mdash;The illiteracy of the soldiery is the
main reason of all these phenomena. It is not, of course, the fault
of our people that it is illiterate. For this the old rÃ©gime is entirely
responsible, as it looked upon education from the point of view
of the Ministry of the Interior. Nevertheless, we have to reckon
with the fact that the masses do not understand the gravity of
our position, and that they misinterpret even such ideas as may
be considered reasonable.... If we do not wish Russia to
collapse, we must continue the struggle and we must advance.
Otherwise we shall witness a grotesque sight. The representatives
of oppressed Russia fought heroically; but having overthrown the
government that was striving for peace with dishonour, the
citizens of free Russia are refusing to fight and to safeguard their
liberties. This is grotesque, strange, incomprehensible. But it
is so. The reason is that discipline has gone and there is no faith
in the Commanding Officers. Mother Country, to most men, is
an empty sound. These conditions are most painful, but they are
particularly painful on the Roumanian front, where one has to
reckon not only with military surroundings of specific difficulty,
but also with a very complex political atmosphere. Our people
are used to plains, and the mountainous nature of the theatre of
war has a depressing effect upon the troops. We often hear the
complaint: &ldquo;Do not keep us in these cursed mountains.&rdquo; We have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
only one railway line to rely upon for supplies, and have great
difficulty in feeding the troops. This, of course, enhances discontent.
The fact that we are fighting on Roumanian territory is
interpreted as a fight &ldquo;for Roumania,&rdquo; which is also an unpopular
idea. The attitude of the local population is not always friendly,
and the men come to the conclusion that they are being refused
assistance by those on whose behalf they are fighting. Friction
thus arises and deepens, because some of the Roumanians blame
us for the defeats which they have themselves suffered and owing
to which they have lost most of their territory and of their belongings.
The Roumanian Government and the Allied representatives
are well aware of the ferment in our Army, and their attitude
towards us is changing. I personally noticed that a shadow has
fallen between us, and that the former respect and faith in the
prowess of the Russian Army have vanished. I still enjoy great
authority, but if the disruption of the Army continues not only
shall we lose our Allies but make enemies of them, and there
would then be a danger of peace being made at our expense. In
1914 we advanced across the whole of Galicia. In 1915, in our
retreat, we took at the South-Western front 100,000 prisoners.
You may judge what that retreat was like and what was the spirit
of the troops. In the summer of 1916 we saved Italy from disaster.
Is it possible that we may now abandon the Allied cause and be
false to our obligations? The Army is in a state of disruption,
but that can be remedied. Should we succeed, within a month and
a half our brave officers and men would advance again. History
will wonder at the inadequate means with which we achieved
brilliant results in 1916. If you wish to raise the Russian Army
and to convert it into a strong organised body which will dictate
the terms of peace, you must help us. All is not lost yet, but only
on condition that the Commanding Officers will regain prestige
and confidence. We hope that full powers in the Army will once
again be vested in the Supreme Commander-in-Chief, who alone
can manage the troops. We will obey the will of the Provisional
Government, but you must give us strong support.</p>

<p><i>General Gourko.</i>&mdash;If you wish to continue the War till the
desired end, you must restore the power of the Army. We have
received the draft of the &ldquo;Declaration&rdquo; (of the rights of the
soldier). Gutchkov would not sign it and has resigned. I am
bound to say that if a civilian has resigned and refused to sign
that declaration&mdash;to us, the Army Chiefs, it is inacceptable. It
simply completely destroys everything that is left. I will recount
to you an episode which occurred while I was temporarily holding
the office of Chief-of-Staff of the Supreme C.-in-C.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>

<p>On February 13th I had a long talk with the late Czar, trying
to persuade him to grant a responsible ministry. As a last trump
card, I alluded to our international position, to the attitude of our
Allies and to the probable consequences of this measure. But
my card was already beaten. I will now endeavour to describe our
international position. We have no direct indication of the attitude
of our Allies towards our intentions to give up the struggle. We
cannot, of course, force them to express their innermost thoughts.
As in time of war, one is often compelled to come to a decision
&ldquo;for the enemy,&rdquo; I will now try to argue &ldquo;for the Allies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was easy to begin the Revolution, but we have been submerged
by its tidal wave. I trust that common sense will help
us to survive this. If not, if the Allies realise our impotence, the
principles of practical policy will force upon them the only issue&mdash;a
separate peace. That would not be on their part a breach of
obligations, because we had promised to fight together and have
now come to a standstill. If one of the parties is fighting and the
other is sitting in the trenches, like a Chinese dragon, waiting for
the result of the fight&mdash;you must agree that the fighting side may
begin to think of making separate peace. Such a peace would, of
course, be concluded at our expense. The Austrians and the
Germans can get nothing from our Allies: their finance is in a
state of collapse and they have no natural riches. Our finances
are also in a state of collapse, but we have immense untouched
natural resources. Our Allies would, of course, come to such a
decision only as a last resort, because it would be not peace, but
a lengthy armistice. Bred as they are upon the ideals of the
nineteenth century, the Germans, having enriched themselves at
our expense, would once again fall upon us and upon our late
Allies. You may say that if this is possible why should we not
conclude a separate peace first. Here I will mention first of all
the moral aspect of the question. The obligation was undertaken
by Russia, not merely by the late autocrat. I was aware&mdash;long
before you had heard of it&mdash;of the duplicity of the Czar, who had
concluded soon after the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-5 an alliance
with the Emperor William, while the Franco-Russian Alliance was
still in existence. The free Russian people, responsible for its
acts, cannot renounce its obligations. But setting aside the moral
aspect, there remains the material problem. If we open negotiations
they cannot remain secret, and our Allies would hear of it
within two or three days. They would also enter into a parley,
and a kind of auction sale would begin. The Allies are, of course,
richer than ourselves, but on their side the struggle has not yet
ended; besides, our enemies could get much more at our expense.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
It is precisely from the international point of view that we must
prove our capacity for a continued struggle. I will not continue
to revolutionise the Army, because if I should we might find ourselves
powerless not only to advance but even to remain on the
defensive. The latter is infinitely more difficult. In 1915 we
retreated and orders were obeyed. You were entitled to expect
this, because we had trained the Army. The position has now
been altered; you have created something new and have deprived
us of power. You can no longer hold us responsible, and the
responsibility must fall heavily upon your heads. You say that
the Revolution is still proceeding. Listen to us. We are better
acquainted with the psychology of the troops, we have gone with
them through thick and thin. Stop the Revolution and give us,
the military Chiefs, a chance to do our duty and to bring Russia
to such a condition in which you may continue your work. Otherwise,
we will hand over to you not Russia, but a field in which
our enemies will sow and reap, and Democracy itself will curse
you. It will be Democracy that will suffer if the Germans win.
Democracy will be starving&mdash;while the peasants will always manage
to feed themselves on their own land. It was said of the old rÃ©gime
that it &ldquo;played into the hands of William.&rdquo; Will it be possible to
level the same accusation against you? William is fortunate
indeed, as both Monarchs and Democracies are playing into his
hands. The Army is on the eve of disruption. Our Mother
Country is in danger and is nearing a collapse. You must help.
It is easy to destroy, and if you know how to destroy&mdash;you should
also know how to rebuild.</p>

<p><i>General Alexeiev.</i>&mdash;The main points have been stated, and
they are true. The Army is on the brink of the abyss. Another
step and it will fall into the abyss and will drag along Russia and
all her liberties, and there will be no return. Everyone is guilty,
and the guilt lies heavily upon all that has been done in that
direction for the last two and a half months. We have made every
effort and are now devoting all our strength to the task of restoring
the Army. We trust that Mr. Kerensky will apply all his
qualities of mind and character and all his influence to that consummation,
and will help us. But that is not enough. Those who
have been disrupting the Army must also help. Those who have
issued the Order No. 1 must issue a series of orders and comments.
If the &ldquo;Declaration&rdquo; is published, as Gutchkov said, the last
flimsy foundations will fall into dust and the last hope will be
dashed. Be patient, there is time still. That which has been
granted in the last two and a half months has not as yet taken
root. We have regulations defining rights and duties. All the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
regulations that are issued nowadays only mention rights. You
must do away with the idea that peace will come by itself. Those
who say &ldquo;down with the War&rdquo; are traitors, and those who say
&ldquo;there should be no advance&rdquo; are cowards. We still have men
with sincere convictions. Let them come to us not as passing
stars, but let them live with us and dispel the misunderstandings
that have arisen. You have the Press. May it encourage
patriotism and demand that everyone do his duty.</p>

<p><i>Prince Lvov.</i>&mdash;We have heard the Commanders-in-Chief, we
understand all they have said and will do our duty to our country
till the end.</p>

<p><i>Tzeretelli.</i>&mdash;There is no one here who has contributed to the
disruption of the Army and played into the hands of William. I
have heard the accusation that the Soviet has contributed to the
disruption of the Army. And yet everyone agrees that the Soviet
is the only institution that enjoys authority at present. What
would happen were there no Soviet? Fortunately, Democracy has
come to the rescue and we still have hope in salvation. What
can you do? There are only two paths for you to follow. One is
to reject the policy of the Soviets. But you would then have no
source of power wherewith to hold the Army and to lead it for
the salvation of Russia. Your other path is the true path, which
we have tried; the path of unity with the desires and expectations
of the people. If the Commanding Officers have failed to make
it quite clear that the whole strength of the Army for the defence
of the country lay in the advance, there is no magic wand capable
of doing it. It is alleged that the watchword &ldquo;Without annexations
or indemnities&rdquo; has demoralised the Army and the masses.
It is quite likely that it has been misunderstood, but it should
have been explained that this was the ultimate aim; we cannot
renounce that watchword. We are aware that Russia is in danger,
but her defence is a matter for the people as a whole. The Power
must be united and must enjoy the confidence of the people, but
this can only be achieved if the old policy is completely discarded.
Unity can only be based on confidence, which cannot be bought.
The ideals of the Soviet are not those of separate and small
groups&mdash;they are the ideals of the country. To renounce them
is to renounce the country. You might, perhaps, understand
Order No. 1 if you knew the conditions in which it was issued.
We were confronted with an unorganised mob and we had to
organise it. The masses of the soldiery do not wish to go on
with the War. They are wrong, and I cannot believe that they
are prompted by cowardice. It is the result of distrust. Discipline
should remain. But if the soldiers realise that you are not fighting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
against Democracy, they will trust you. By this means the Army
may yet be saved. By this means the authority of the Soviet will
be strengthened. There is only one way of salvation, the way of
confidence and of the Democratisation of the country and of the
Army. It is by accepting those principles that the Soviet has
gained the confidence of the people and is now in a position to
carry out its ideas. As long as that is so, not all is lost. You
must try to enhance the confidence in the Soviet.</p>

<p><i>Skobelev.</i>&mdash;We have not come here to listen to reproaches.
We know what is going on in the Army. The conditions which
you have described are undoubtedly ominous. It will depend upon
the spirit of the Russian people whether the ultimate goal will be
reached and whether we shall come out of the present difficulty
with honour. I consider it necessary to explain the circumstances
in which Order No. 1 was issued. In the troops which had overthrown
the old rÃ©gime, the Commanding Officers had not joined
the mutineers; we were compelled to issue that Order so as to
deprive these officers of authority. We were anxious about the
attitude of the front towards the Revolution and about the instructions
that were being given. We have proved to-day that
our misgivings were not unfounded. Let us speak the truth:
the activities of the Commanding Staff have prevented the Army,
in these two and a half months, from understanding the Revolution.
We quite realise the difficulties of your position. But when
you say that the Revolution must be stayed, we are bound to reply
that the Revolution cannot begin or end to order. Revolution
may take its normal course when the mental process of the
Revolution spreads all over the country, when it is understood by
the 70 per cent. of illiterate people.</p>

<p>Far be it from us to demand that all Commanding Officers be
elected. We agree with you that we have power and have
succeeded in attaining it. When you will understand the aims of
the Revolution and will help the people to understand our watchword,
you will also acquire the necessary power. The people must
know what they are fighting for. You are leading the Army for
the defeat of the enemy, and you must explain that a strategical
advance is necessary in order that the watchwords that have been
proclaimed may be vindicated. We trust the new War Minister
and hope that a revolutionary Minister will continue our work
and will hasten the mental process of the Revolution in the heads
of those who think too slowly.</p>

<p><i>The War Minister&mdash;Kerensky.</i>&mdash;As Minister and Member of
the Government, I must say that we are trying to save the country
and to restore the fighting capacity and activities of the Russian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
Army. <i>We assume responsibility, but we also assume the right
to lead the Army</i> and to show it the path of future development.
Nobody has been uttering reproaches here. Everyone has described
what he has lived through and has tried to define the
causes of events, but our aims and desires are the same. The
Provisional Government recognises that the Soviet has played a
prominent part and admits its work of organisation&mdash;otherwise I
would not be War Minister. No one can level accusations at the
Soviet. But no one can accuse the Commanding Staffs either,
because the officers have borne the brunt of the Revolution quite
as much as the rest of the Russian people. Everyone understands
the position. Now that my comrades are joining the
Government, it will be easier to attain our common aims. There
is but one thing for us to do&mdash;to save our freedom. I will ask
you to proceed to your commands and to remember that the whole
of Russia stands behind you and behind the Army. It is our
aim to give our country complete freedom. But this cannot be
done unless we show the world at large that we are strong in
spirit.</p>

<p><i>General Gourko</i> (replying to Skobelev and Tzeretelli).&mdash;We are
discussing the matter from different angles. Discipline is the
fundamental condition of the existence of the Army. The percentage
of losses which a unit may suffer without losing its fighting
capacity is the measure of its endurance. I have spent eight
months in the South African Republics and have seen regiments of
two different kinds: (1) Small, disciplined and (2) Volunteer, undisciplined.
The former continued to fight and did not lose their
fighting power when their losses amounted to 50 per cent. The
latter, although they were volunteers who knew what they were
fighting for, left the ranks and fled from the battlefield after losing
10 per cent. No force on earth could induce them to fight. That
is the difference between disciplined and undisciplined troops. We
demand discipline. We do all we can to persuade. But your
authoritative voice must be heard. We must remember that if
the enemy advances, we shall fall to pieces like a pack of cards.
If you will not cease to revolutionise the Army&mdash;you must assume
power yourselves.</p>

<p><i>Prince Lvov.</i>&mdash;Our ends are the same and everyone will do
his duty. I thank you for your visit and for giving us your views.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Conference came to a close. The Commanders-in-Chief
rejoined their fronts, fully conscious that the last card had been
beaten. At the same time, the Soviet orators and the Press started<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
a campaign of abuse against Generals Alexeiev, Gourko and
Dragomirov, which rendered their resignations imperative. On
the 9th of May, as I already mentioned, Kerensky confirmed the
&ldquo;Declaration&rdquo; while issuing an Order of the Day on the inadmissibility
of senior Commanding Officers relinquishing their posts
&ldquo;in order to shirk responsibility.&rdquo; What was the impression
produced by that fateful Order?</p>

<p>Kerensky <i>afterwards</i> tried to adduce the excuse that the regulation
was drafted before he had assumed office and was approved of
by the Executive Committee as well as by &ldquo;military authorities,&rdquo;
and that he had no reason to refuse to confirm it; in a word, that
he was compelled to do so. But I recall more than one of
Kerensky&rsquo;s speeches in which, believing his course to be the right
one, he prided himself on his courage in issuing a Declaration
&ldquo;which Gutchkov had not dared to sign, and which had evoked
the protests of all the Commanding Officers.&rdquo; On May 13th the
Executive Committee of the Soviets responded to the Declaration
by an enthusiastic proclamation which dwelt mainly upon the
question of saluting. Poor, indeed, was the mind that inspired
this verbiage: &ldquo;Two months we have waited for this day....
Now the soldier is by law a citizen.... Henceforward the
citizen soldier is free from the servile saluting, and will greet
anyone he chooses as an equal and free man.... In the Revolutionary
Army discipline will live through popular enthusiasm
... and not by means of compulsory saluting....&rdquo; Such
were the men who undertook to reorganise the Army.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, the majority of the Revolutionary Democracy
of the Soviets were not satisfied with the Declaration. They
described it as &ldquo;a new enslavement of the soldier,&rdquo; and a campaign
was opened for further widening of these rights. Members
of the Defencist coalition demanded that the Regimental Committees
should be empowered to challenge the appointments of
the Commanding Officers and to give them attestations, as well
as that freedom of speech should be granted on service. Their
chief demand, however, was for the exclusion of Paragraph 14
of the Declaration entitling the Commanding Officer to use arms
in the firing line against insubordination. I need hardly mention
the disapproval of the Left, &ldquo;Defeatist&rdquo; Section of the Soviet.</p>

<p>The Liberal Press utterly failed to appraise the importance of
the Declaration and never treated it seriously. The official organ
of the Constitutional Democratic Party (<i>Retch</i>, May 11th) had an
article which expressed great satisfaction that the Declaration
&ldquo;afforded every soldier the chance of taking part in the political
life of the country, definitely freed him from the shackles of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
old rÃ©gime and led him from the stale atmosphere of the old
barracks into the fresh air of liberty.&rdquo; It also said that &ldquo;throughout
the world all other armies are remote from politics, whilst the
Russian Army will be the first to enjoy the fullness of political
rights.&rdquo; Even the Conservative paper (<i>Novoc Vremia</i>) said in a
leading article: &ldquo;It is a memorable day; to-day the great Army
of mighty Russia becomes truly the Army of the Revolution....
Intercourse between warriors of all ranks will henceforward
be placed upon the common foundation of a sense of duty
binding on every citizen, irrespective of rank. And the Revolutionary
Army of regenerated Russia will go forward to the great
ordeal of blood with faith in victory and in peace.&rdquo; Difficult,
indeed, was the task of the Commanding Officers who were
endeavouring to preserve the Army when they found that the
fundamental principles upon which the very existence of the Army
depended were misunderstood so grossly, even in circles which
had heretofore been considered as the mainstay of Russian
statesmanship.</p>

<p>The Commanding Officers were still more disheartened, and
the Army fell into the abyss with ever-increasing rapidity.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI.</a><br />
<span class="smcap">The Press and Propaganda.</span></h2>

<p>In the late World War, along with aeroplanes, tanks, poison
gases and other marvels of military <i>technique</i>, a new and
powerful weapon came to the fore, viz: <i>propaganda</i>.
Strictly speaking, it was not altogether new, for as far back as
1826 Canning said, in the House of Commons: &ldquo;Should we ever
have to take part in a war we shall gather under our flag all the
rebels, all those who, with or without cause, are discontented in
the country that goes against us.&rdquo; But now this means of conflict
attained an extraordinary development, intensity and organisation,
attacking the most morbid and sensitive points of national psychology.
Organised on a large scale, supplied with vast means,
the propaganda organs of Great Britain, France and America,
especially those of Great Britain, carried on a terrible warfare by
word of mouth, in the Press, in the films and ... with gold,
extending this warfare over the territories of the enemy, the Allies
and the neutrals, introducing it into all spheres&mdash;military,
political, moral and economic. The more so, that Germany
especially gave grounds enough for propaganda to have a plentiful
supply of irrefragable, evidential material at its disposal. It
is difficult to enumerate, even in their general features alone, that
enormous arsenal of ideas which, step by step, drop by drop,
deepened class differences, undermined the power of the State,
sapped the moral powers of the enemy and their confidence in
victory, disintegrated their alliance, roused the neutral powers
against them and finally raised the falling spirits of their allied
peoples. Nevertheless, we should not attach exceptional importance
to this external moral pressure, as the leaders of the German
people are now doing, to justify themselves: Germany has suffered
a political, economic, military and moral defeat. It was only the
interaction of all these factors that determined the fatal issue of the
struggle, which, towards its end, became a lingering death-agony.
One could only marvel at the vitality of the German people,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
which, by its intellectual power and the stability of its political
thought, held out so long, until at last, in November, 1918, &ldquo;a
double death-blow, both at the front and in the rear,&rdquo; laid it in
the dust. In connection with this, history will undoubtedly note
a great analogy between the parts played by the &ldquo;Revolutionary
Democracies&rdquo; of Russia and of Germany in the destinies of these
peoples. After the <i>dÃ©bÃ¢cle</i> the leader of the German Independent
Social Democrats acquainted the country with the great
and systematic work which they had carried on, from the beginning
of 1918, for the breaking down of the German Army and
Navy, to the glory of the social revolution. In this work one
is struck by the similarity of method and <i>modus operandi</i> with
those practised in Russia.</p>

<p>While unable to resist British and French propaganda, the
Germans were very successful in applying this means to their
Eastern antagonist, the more so that: &ldquo;Russia created her own
misfortunes,&rdquo; said Ludendorff, &ldquo;and the work which we carried
on there was not too hard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The results of the interaction of the skilful hand of Germany
with the movements which arose, less from the fact itself of the
Revolution than from the individual character of the Russian
rebellion, exceeded the highest hopes of the Germans.</p>

<p>The work was carried on in three directions&mdash;political, military
and social. In the first we note the idea, quite clearly and definitely
formulated and systematically carried out by the German Government,
<i>of the dismemberment of Russia</i>. Its realisation took shape
in the proclamation, on November 15, 1916, of the Kingdom of
Poland<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> <i>with a territory which was to extend eastward &ldquo;as far
as possible&rdquo;</i>; in the creation of the States of Courland and
Lithuania&mdash;&ldquo;independent,&rdquo; but in union with Germany; in the
sharing of the White Russian provinces between Poland and
Lithuania, and, finally, in the prolonged and very persistent preparation
of the secession of Little Russia, which took place later,
in 1918. While the former facts had a meaning only in principle,
concerning, as they did, territories actually occupied by the
Germans and defined the character of the future &ldquo;annexations,&rdquo;
the attitude assumed by the Central Powers with respect to Little
Russia exercised a direct influence on the stability of our South-Western
front, creating political complications in the country and
separatist tendencies in the Army. I shall return to this question
later.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span></p>

<p>The German Headquarters included an excellently organised
&ldquo;press-bureau,&rdquo; which, besides influencing and directing the home
Press, also guided German propaganda, which penetrated mainly
into Russia and France. Miliukov quotes a circular issued by the
German Foreign Office to all its representatives in neutral
countries: &ldquo;You are informed that on the territory of the country
to which you are accredited, special offices have been instituted for
the organisation of propaganda in the States, now fighting with
the German coalition. The propaganda will be engaged in exciting
the social movement and, in connection with the latter, strikes,
revolutionary outbreaks, separatism, among the constituent parts
of these States, and civil war, as well as agitation in favour of
disarmament and the cessation of the present sanguinary slaughter.
You are instructed to afford all possible protection and support to
the directors of the said propaganda offices.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It is curious that, in the summer of 1917, the British Press took
up arms against Sir George Buchanan and the British Propaganda
Ministry for their inertness in the matter of influencing the Democracy
of Russia and of fighting German propaganda in that
country. One of the papers pointed out that the British bureau
of Russian propaganda had at its head a novelist and literary
beginners who had &ldquo;as much idea of Russia as of Chinese
metaphysics.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As for us, neither in our Government departments nor at the
Stavka did we have any organ whatever which was even in some
degree reminiscent of the mighty Western propaganda institutions.
One of the sections of the Quartermaster-General&rsquo;s department had
charge of technical questions, concerning relations with the Press,
and was left without importance, influence, or any active task. The
Russian Army, well or badly, fought in primitive ways, without
ever having recourse to that &ldquo;poisoning of the enemy&rsquo;s spirit,&rdquo;
which was so widely practised in the West. And it paid for this
with superfluous torrents of blood. But if opinions may differ
regarding the morality of destructive propaganda, we cannot
but note our complete inertness and inactivity in another and
perfectly pure sphere. We did absolutely nothing to acquaint
foreign public opinion with the exceptionally important part played
by Russia and the Russian Army in the World War, with the
enormous losses suffered and the sacrifices made by the Russian
people, with those constant majestic deeds of self-sacrifice, incomprehensible,
perhaps, to the cold understanding of our Western
friends, which the Russian Army made whenever the Allied front
was within a hair&rsquo;s-breadth of defeat.... Such a want of
comprehension of the part played by Russia I have met with almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
everywhere, in wide social circles, long after the conclusion of
peace, in my wanderings over Europe.</p>

<p>The following small episode is a burlesque, but very characteristic
instance of this. On a banner presented to Marshal Foch
&ldquo;from American friends&rdquo; are depicted the flags of all countries,
lands and colonies, which in one way or another came within
the orbit of the Entente; the Russian flag occupies the forty-sixth
place, after Hayti and Uruguay and immediately after San-Marino.</p>

<p>Is this ignorance or triviality?</p>

<p>We did nothing to lay a firm moral foundation for national
unity during our occupation of Galicia, did not draw public opinion
to our side during the occupation of Roumania by the Russian troops,
did nothing to restrain the Bulgarian people from betraying the
interests of the Slavonic races. Finally, we took no advantage of
the presence on Russian soil of an enormous number of prisoners,
to give them at least a correct idea of Russia.</p>

<p>The Stavka, firmly barricaded within the sphere of purely
military questions connected with the carrying out of the campaign,
made no attempt to gain any influence over the general
course of political events, which agrees completely with the service
idea of a national army. But, at the same time, the Stavka distinctly
avoided influencing the public spirit of the country so as to
lead this powerful factor to moral co-operation in the struggle.
There was no connection with the leading organs of the Press,
which was represented at the Stavka by men possessing neither
weight nor influence.</p>

<p>When the thunderstorm of the Revolution broke and the political
whirlwind swept up and convulsed the Army, the Stavka could
remain inert no longer. It had to respond. The more so, that
suddenly no source of moral power was to be found in Russia which
might have protected the Army. The Government, especially the
War Office, rushed irresistibly down the path of opportunism; the
Soviets and the Socialist Press undermined the Army; the Bourgeois
Press now cried &ldquo;videant consules ne quid Imperio
detrimenti caparet,&rdquo; now naÃ¯vely rejoiced at the &ldquo;democratisation
and liberation&rdquo; which were taking place. Even in what might
have been considered the competent spheres of the higher military
bureaucracy of Petrograd there reigned such a variety of views,
as plunged the public opinion of the country into perplexity and
bewilderment.</p>

<p>It turned out, however, that for the conflict the Stavka
possessed neither organisation nor men, neither technique nor
knowledge and experience. And, worst of all, the Stavka was
in some way or other shoved and thrown aside by the madly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>-careering
chariot of life. Its voice grew weaker and sank into
silence.</p>

<p class="caption">The Revolutionary Army: a review. Kerensky.</p></div>

<p>The second Quartermaster-General&mdash;General Markov&mdash;had a
serious task before him&mdash;he had to create the necessary apparatus,
to establish communications with the important papers, to supply
the Stavka with a &ldquo;megaphone&rdquo; and raise the condition of the
Army Press, which was leading a wretched existence and which
the army organisations were trying to destroy. Markov took up
the task warmly, but failed to do anything serious, as he only
remained in office two months. Every step of the Stavka in
this direction called forth from the Revolutionary Democracy a
disingenuous accusation of counter-revolutionary action. And
Liberal Bourgeois Moscow, to which he turned for aid, in the form
of intellectual and technical assistance in his task, replied with
eloquent promises, but did absolutely nothing.</p>

<p>Thus the Stavka had no means at all, not only for actively
combating the disintegration of the Army, but for resisting
German propaganda, which was spreading rapidly.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Ludendorff says frankly and with a national egotism rising to
a high degree of cynicism: &ldquo;I did not doubt that the <i>dÃ©bÃ¢cle</i> of
the Russian Army and the Russian people was fraught with great
danger for Germany and Austria-Hungary.... <i>In sending
Lenin to Russia</i> our Government assumed an enormous
responsibility! This journey was justified from a military point
of view; <i>it was necessary that Russia should fall</i>. But our
Government should have taken measures that this should not
happen to Germany.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>Even now the boundless sufferings of the Russian people, now
&ldquo;out of the ranks,&rdquo; did not call forth a single word of pity or
regret from its moral corrupters....</p>

<p>With the beginning of the campaign, the Germans altered the
direction of their work with respect to Russia. Without breaking
their connections with the well-known reactionary circles at
Court, in the Government and in the Duma, using all means for
influencing these circles and all their motives&mdash;greed, ambition,
German atavism, and sometimes a peculiar understanding of
patriotism&mdash;the Germans entered at the same time into close
fellowship with the Russian Revolutionaries in the country, and
especially abroad, amongst the multitudinous emigrant colony.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
Directly or indirectly, all were drawn into the service of the
German Government&mdash;great agents in the sphere of spying and
recruiting, like Parvus (Helfand); provocateurs, connected with
the Russian Secret Police, like Blum; propaganda agents&mdash;Oulianoff
(Lenin), Bronstein (Trotsky), Apfelbaum (Zinovieff),
Lunacharsky, Ozolin, Katz (Kamkoff), and many others. And
in their wake went a whole group of shallow or unscrupulous
people, cast over the frontier and fanatically hating the <i>rÃ©gime</i>
which had rejected them&mdash;hating it to the degree of forgetfulness
of their native land, or squaring accounts with this <i>rÃ©gime</i>,
acting sometimes as blind tools in the hands of the German General
Staff. What their motives were, what their pay, how far they
went&mdash;these are details; what is important is that they sold Russia,
serving those aims which were set before them by our foe. They
were all closely interlaced with one another and with the agents
of the German Secret Service, forming with them one unbroken
conspiracy.</p>

<p>The work began with a widespread Revolutionary and Separatist
(Ukrainian) propaganda among the prisoners of war. According
to Liebknecht, &ldquo;the German Government not only helped this
propaganda, but carried it on itself.&rdquo; These aims were served by
the Committee of Revolutionary Propaganda, founded in 1915 at
The Hague by the Union for the Liberation of the Ukraine in
Austria by the Copenhagen Institute (Parvus&rsquo;s organisation), and
a whole series of papers of a Revolutionary and Defeatist
character, partly published at the expense of the German Staff,
partly subsidised by it&mdash;the <i>Social Democrat</i> (Geneva&mdash;Lenin&rsquo;s
paper), <i>Nashe Slovo</i> (Paris&mdash;Trotsky&rsquo;s paper), <i>Na Tchoozhbeenie</i>
(Geneva&mdash;contributions from Tchernoff, Katz and others),
<i>Russkii Viestnik</i>, <i>Rodnaya Retch</i>, <i>Nedielia</i>, and so forth. Similar
to this was the activity&mdash;the spread of Defeatist and Revolutionary
literature, side by side with purely charitable work&mdash;of the
Committee of Intellectual Aid to Russian Prisoners of War in
Germany and Austria (Geneva), which was in connection with
official Moscow and received subsidies from it.</p>

<p>To define the character of these publications it is enough to
quote two or three phrases expressing the views of their inspirers.
Lenin said in the <i>Social Democrat</i>: &ldquo;The least evil will be the
defeat of the Czarist monarchy, the most barbarous and
reactionary of all Governments.&rdquo; Tchernoff, the future Minister
of Agriculture, declared in the <i>Mysl</i> that he had one Fatherland
only&mdash;the International!</p>

<p>Along with literature the Germans invited Lenin&rsquo;s and Tchernoff&rsquo;s
collaborators, especially from the editorial staff of <i>Na<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
Tchoozhbeenie</i>, to lecture in the camps, while a German spy,
Consul Von Pelche, carried on a large campaign for the recruiting
of agitators for propaganda in the ranks of the Army&mdash;among the
Russian emigrants of conscript age and of Left Wing politics.</p>

<p>All this was but preparatory work. The Russian Revolution
opened boundless vistas for German propaganda. Along with
honest people, once persecuted, who had struggled for the good
of the people, there rushed into Russia all that revolutionary riff-raff
which absorbed the members of the Russian secret police, the
international informers and the rebels.</p>

<p>The Petrograd authorities feared most of all the accusation
of want of Democratic spirit. Miliukov, as Minister, stated
repeatedly that &ldquo;the Government considers unconditionally possible
the return to Russia of all emigrants, regardless of their
views on the War and independently of their registration in the
International Control List.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> This Minister carried on a dispute
with the British, demanding the release of the Bolsheviks,
Bronstein (Trotsky), Zourabov and others, who had been arrested
by the British.</p>

<p>Matters were more complicated in the case of Lenin and his
supporters. Despite the demands of the Russian Government,
the Allies would undoubtedly have refused to let them through.
Therefore, as Ludendorff acknowledges, the German Government
despatched Lenin and his companions (the first group
consisted of seventeen persons) to Russia, allowing them free
transit through Germany. This undertaking, which promised
extraordinarily important results, was richly financed with
gold and credit through the Stockholm (Ganetsky-Fuerstenberg)
and Copenhagen (Parvus) centres and through the Russian
Siberian Bank. That gold which, as Lenin expressed it, &ldquo;does
not smell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In October, 1917, Bourtsev published a list of 159 persons
brought through Germany to Russia by order of the German
General Staff. Nearly all of them, according to Bourtsev, &ldquo;were
revolutionaries who, during the War, had carried on a defeatist
campaign in Switzerland and were now William&rsquo;s voluntary or
involuntary agents.&rdquo; Many of them at once assumed a prominent
position in the Social Democratic party, in the Soviet, the Committee<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
and the Bolshevik Press. The names of Lenin, Tseder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>baum
(Martov), Lunacharsky, Natanson, Riazanov, Apfelbaum
(Zinoviev) and others soon became the most fateful in Russian
history.</p>

<p>On the day of Lenin&rsquo;s arrival in Petrograd the German paper
<i>Die Woche</i> devoted an article to this event, in which he was called
&ldquo;a true friend of the Russian people and an honourable
antagonist.&rdquo; And the Cadet semi-official organ, the <i>Retch</i>, which
afterwards boldly and unwaveringly waged war against the Lenin
party, greeted his arrival with the words: &ldquo;Such a generally
acknowledged leader of the Socialist party ought now to be in
the arena, and his arrival in Russia, whatever opinion may be held
of his views, should be welcomed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On April 3rd Lenin arrived in Petrograd, where he was received
with much state, and in a few days declared his theses, part of
which formed the fundamental themes of German propaganda:
&ldquo;Down with war and all power to the Soviet!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lenin&rsquo;s first actions seemed so absurd and so clearly anarchistic
that they called forth protests not only in the whole of the Liberal
Press, but also in the greater part of the Socialist Press.</p>

<p>But, little by little, the Left Wing of the Revolutionary Democracy,
reinforced by German agents, joined overtly and openly
in the propaganda of its chief, without meeting any decisive rebuff
either from the double-minded Soviet or the feeble Government.
The great wave of German and mutinous propaganda engulfed
more and more the Soviet, the Committee, the Revolutionary
Press, and the ignorant masses, and was reflected, consciously
or unconsciously, even among those who stood at the helm of
the State.</p>

<p>From the very first Lenin&rsquo;s organisation, as was said afterwards,
in July, in the report of the Procurator of the Petrograd
High Court of Justice, &ldquo;aiming at assisting the States warring
against Russia in their hostile actions against her, entered into an
agreement with the agents of the said States to forward the disorganisation
of the Russian Army and the Russian rear, for which
purpose it used the financial means received from these States to
organise a propaganda among the population and the troops
... and also, for the same purpose, organised in Petrograd,
from July 3rd to 5th, an armed insurrection against the Supreme
Power existing in the State.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Stavka had long and vainly raised its voice of warning.
General Alexeiev had, both personally and in writing, called on
the Government to take measures against the Bolsheviks and the
spies. Several times I myself applied to the War Office, sending
in, among other things, evidential material concerning Rakovsky&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
spying and documents certifying the treason of Lenin, Skoropis-Yoltoukhovsky
and others. The part played by the Union for
the Liberation of the Ukraine (of which, besides others,
Melenevsky and V. Doroshenko were members)<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> as an organisation
of the Central Powers for propaganda, spying and recruiting
for &ldquo;Setch Ukraine units,&rdquo; was beyond all doubt. In one of
my letters (May 16th), based on the examination of a Russian officer,
Yermolenko, who had been a prisoner of war and had accepted
the part of a German agent for the purpose of disclosing the
organisation, the following picture was revealed: &ldquo;Yermolenko
was transferred to our rear, on the front of the Sixth Army, to
agitate for a speedy conclusion of a separate peace with Germany.
Yermolenko accepted this commission at the insistence
of his comrades. Two officers of the German General Staff,
Schiditzky and Lubar, informed him that a similar agitation was
being carried on in Russia by the sectional president of the Union
for the Liberation of the Ukraine, A. Skoropis-Yoltoukhovsky,
and by Lenin, as agents of the German General Staff. Lenin
had been instructed to seek to undermine by all means the confidence
of the Russian people in the Provisional Government.
The money for this work was received through one Svendson, an
employee of the German Embassy in Stockholm. These methods
were practised before the Revolution also. Our command turned
its attention to the somewhat too frequent appearance of
&ldquo;escaped prisoners.&rdquo; Many of them having surrendered to the
enemy, passed through a definite course of intelligence work,
and having received substantial pay and &ldquo;papers,&rdquo; were permitted
to pass over to us through the line of trenches.</p>

<p>Being altogether unable to decide what was a case of courage
and what of treachery, we nearly always sent all escaped prisoners
from the European to the Caucasian Front.</p>

<p>All the representations of the High Command as to the
insufferable situation of the Army, in the face of such vast
treachery, remained without result. Kerensky carried on free
debates in the Soviet with Lenin on the subject whether the
country and the Army should be broken down or not, basing his
action on the view that he was the &ldquo;War Minister of the Revolution,&rdquo;
and that &ldquo;freedom of opinion was sacred to him, whencesoever
it might proceed.&rdquo; Tzeretelli warmly defended Lenin:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
&ldquo;I do not agree with Lenin and his agitation. But what has
been said by Deputy Shulgin is a slander against Lenin,
<i>Never has Lenin called for actions which would infringe upon the
course of the Revolution. Lenin is carrying on an idealist
propaganda.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>This much-talked-of freedom of opinion extremely simplified the
work of German propaganda, giving rise to such an unheard-of
phenomenon as the open preaching in German, at public
meetings and in Kronstadt, of a separate peace and of
distrust of the Government, by an agent of Germany, the
President of the Zimmerwald and Kienthal Conference, Robert
Grimm!...</p>

<p>What a state of moral prostration and loss of all national
dignity, consciousness, and patriotism is presented by the picture
of Tzeretelli and Skobelev &ldquo;vouching&rdquo; for the <i>agent provocateur</i>;
of Kerensky importuning the Government to grant Grimm
the right of entry into Russia; of Tereshtchenko permitting it,
and of Russians listening to Grimm&rsquo;s speeches&mdash;without indignation,
without resentment.</p>

<p>During the Bolshevik insurrection of July the officials of the
Ministry of Justice, exasperated by the laxity of the leaders of
the Government, decided, with the knowledge of their Minister,
Pereverzev, to publish my letter to the Minister of War and other
documents, exposing Lenin&rsquo;s treason to his country. The documents
being a statement signed by two Socialists, Alexinsky and
Pankratov, were given to the printers. The premature disclosure
of this fact called forth a passionate protest from Tchkheidze and
Tzeretelli, and terrible anger on the part of the Ministers
Nekrassov and Tereshtchenko. The Government forbade the
publication of information which sullied the good name of comrade
Lenin, and had recourse to reprisals against the officials
of the Ministry of Justice. However, the statement appeared in
the Press. In its turn the Executive Committee of the Soviet of
Workmen&rsquo;s and Soldiers&rsquo; Delegates exhibited a touching care, not
only for the inviolability of the Bolsheviks, but even for their
honour, by issuing on July 5th a special appeal calling on people
&ldquo;to refrain from the spreading of accusations reflecting dishonour&rdquo;
on Lenin and &ldquo;other political workers&rdquo; pending the
investigation of the matter by a special commission. This consideration
was openly expressed in a resolution passed by the
Central Executive Committees (on July 8th), which, while condemning
the attempt of the Anarchist-Bolshevist elements to overthrow
the Government, expressed the fear that the &ldquo;inevitable&rdquo;
measures to which the Government and the military authorities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
must have recourse ... would create a basis for the demagogic
agitation of the counter-Revolutionaries who, for the time being,
gathered round the flag of the Revolutionary rÃ©gime, but who
might pave the way for a military Dictatorship.&rdquo;</p>

<p>However, the exposure of the direct criminal participation of
the leaders of Bolshevism in acts of mutiny and treason may
have obliged the Government to begin repressions. Lenin and
Apfelbaum (Zinoviev) escaped to Finland, while Bronstein
(Trotsky), Kozlovsky, Raskolnikov, Remniov, and many others
were arrested. Several Anarchist-Bolshevist newspapers were
suspended.</p>

<p>These repressions, however, were not of a serious character.
Many persons known to have been leaders in the mutiny were not
charged at all, and their work of destruction was continued with
consistency and energy.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>While carrying the war into our country the Germans
persistently and methodically put into practice another watchword&mdash;peace
at the Front. Fraternisation had taken place earlier as
well, before the Revolution; but it was then due to the hopelessly
wearisome life in the trenches, to curiosity, to a simple
feeling of humanity even towards the enemy&mdash;a feeling exhibited
by the Russian soldier more than once on the battlefield of Borodino,
in the bastions of Sevastopol, and in the Balkan mountains.
Fraternisation took place rarely, was punished by the commanders,
and had no dangerous tendencies in it. But now the German
General Staff organised it on a large scale, systematically and
along the whole Front, with the participation of the higher Staff
organs and the commanders, with a detailed code of instructions,
which included the observation of our forces and positions, the
demonstration of the impressive armament and strength of their
own positions, persuasion as to the aimlessness of the War, the
incitement of the Russian soldiers against the Government and
their commanders, in whose interest exclusively this &ldquo;sanguinary
slaughter&rdquo; was being continued. Masses of the Defeatist
literature manufactured in Germany were passed over into our
trenches, and at the same time agents of the Soviet and the
Committee travelled quite freely along the Front with similar
propaganda, with the organisation of &ldquo;exhibition fraternisation,&rdquo;
and with whole piles of <i>Pravda</i>, <i>Trench Pravda</i>, <i>Social Democrat</i>,
and other products of our native Socialist intellect and conscience&mdash;organs
which, in their forceful argumentation, left the Jesuitical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
eloquence of their German brethren far behind. At the same
time a general meeting of simple &ldquo;delegates from the Front&rdquo;
in Petrograd was passing a resolution in favour of allowing
fraternisation for the purpose of revolutionary propaganda among
the enemy&rsquo;s ranks!</p>

<p>One cannot read without deep emotion of the feelings of
Kornilov, who, for the first time after the Revolution, in the
beginning of May, when in command of the Eighth Army, came
into contact with this fatal phenomenon in the life of our Front.
They were written down by Nezhintsev, at that time captain of
the General Staff and later the gallant commander of the Kornilov
Regiment, who in 1918 fell in action against the Bolsheviks at the
storm of Ekaterinodar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When we had got well into the firing zone of the position,&rdquo;
writes Nezhintsev, &ldquo;the General (Kornilov) looked very gloomy.
His words, &lsquo;disgrace, treason,&rsquo; showed his estimate of the dead
silence of the position. Then he remarked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Do you feel all the nightmare horror of this silence? You
understand that we are watched by the enemy artillery observers
and that we are not fired at. Yes, the enemy are mocking us as
weaklings. Can it be that the Russian soldier is capable of
informing the enemy of my arrival at the position?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was silent, but the sacred tears in the eyes of this hero
touched me deeply, and at this moment I vowed in my mind that
I would die for him and for our common Motherland. General
Kornilov seemed to feel this. He turned to me suddenly, pressed
my hand, and turned away, as if ashamed of his momentary
weakness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The acquaintance of the new Commander with the infantry
began with the units in the Reserve, when formed in rank, holding
a meeting and replying to all appeals for the necessity of an
advance by pointing out how useless it was to continue a Bourgeois
war, carried on by &lsquo;militarists.&rsquo; When, after two hours
of fruitless discussion, General Kornilov, worn out morally and
physically, proceeded to the trenches, he found a scene there
which could scarcely have been foreseen by any soldier of this
age.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We entered into a system of fortifications where the trench-lines
of both sides were separated or, more correctly, joined by
lines of barbed wire.... The appearance of General Kornilov
was greeted ... by a group of German officers, who gazed
insolently on the Commander of the Russian Army; behind them
stood some Prussian soldiers. The General took my field-glasses
and, ascending the parapet, began to examine the arena of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
fights to come. When someone expressed a fear that
the Prussians might shoot the Russian Commander, the latter
replied:</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I would be immensely glad if they did; perhaps it might
sober our befogged soldiers and put an end to this shameful
fraternisation.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At the positions of a neighbouring regiment the Commander
of the Army was greeted by the <i>bravura</i> march of a German
Jaeger regiment, to whose band our &lsquo;fraternising&rsquo; soldiers were
making their way. With the remark, &lsquo;This is treason!&rsquo; the
General turned to an officer standing next him, ordering the
fraternisers from both sides to be told that if this disgraceful
scene did not cease at once he would turn the guns loose on them.
The disciplined Germans ceased playing and returned to their
own trenches, seemingly ashamed of the abominable spectacle.
But our soldiers&mdash;oh! they held meetings for a long time, complaining
of the way their &lsquo;counter-Revolutionary commanders
oppressed their liberty.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>In general I do not cherish feelings of revenge. Yet I regret
exceedingly that General Ludendorff left the German Army
prematurely, before its break-up, and did not experience directly
in its ranks those inexpressibly painful moral torments which we
Russian officers have suffered.</p>

<p>Besides fraternisation, the enemy High Command practised,
on an extensive scale and with provocatory purpose, the dispatch
of flags of truce directly to the troops, or rather to the soldiers.
Thus, about the end of April on the Dvinsk Front there came
with a flag of truce a German officer, who was not received. He
managed, however, to address to the crowd of soldiers the words:
&ldquo;I have come to you with offers of peace, and am empowered to
speak even with the Provisional Government, but your commanders
do not wish for peace.&rdquo; These words were spread
rapidly, and caused agitation among the soldiers and even threats
to desert the Front. Therefore when, a few days later, in the same
section, <i>parliamentaires</i> (a brigade commander, two officers, and
a bugler) made their appearance again, they were taken to the
Staff quarters of the Fifth Army. It turned out, of course, that
they had no authorisations, and could not even state more or less
definitely the object of their coming, since &ldquo;the sole object of
the pseudo-<i>parliamentaires</i> appearing on our Front,&rdquo; says an
order of the Commander-in-Chief, &ldquo;has been to observe our dispositions
and our spirit, and, by a lying exhibition of their pacific
feelings, to incline our troops to an inaction profitable to the
Germans and ruinous to Russia and her freedom.&rdquo; Similar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
cases occurred on the Fronts of the Eighth, Ninth, and other
Armies.</p>

<p>It is characteristic that the Commander-in-Chief of the Eastern
German Front, Prince Leopold of Bavaria, found it possible to
take a personal part in this course of provocation. In two radiograms,
bearing the systematic character of the customary
proclamations and intended for the soldiers and the Soviet, he
stated that the High Command was ready to meet half-way &ldquo;the
repeatedly expressed desire of the Russian Soldiers&rsquo; Delegates to
put an end to bloodshed&rdquo;; that &ldquo;military operations between us
(the Central Powers) and Russia could be put an end to <i>without
Russia breaking with her Allies</i>&rdquo;; that &ldquo;if Russia wants to know
the particulars of our conditions, let her give up her demand for
their publication....&rdquo; And he finishes with a threat: &ldquo;Does
the new Russian Government, instigated by its Allies, wish to
satisfy itself whether divisions of heavy guns are still to be found
on our Eastern Front?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Earlier, when leaders did discreditable things to save their
armies and their countries, at least they were ashamed of it and
kept silence. Nowadays military traditions have undergone a
radical change.</p>

<p>To the credit of the Soviet it must be said that it took a proper
view of this provocationary invitation, saying in reply: &ldquo;The
Commander-in-Chief of the German troops on the Eastern Front
offers us &lsquo;a separate truce and secrecy of negotiations.&rsquo; But
Russia knows that the <i>dÃ©bÃ¢cle</i> of the Allies will be the beginning
of the <i>dÃ©bÃ¢cle</i> of her own Army, and the <i>dÃ©bÃ¢cle</i> of the Revolutionary
troops of Free Russia would mean not only new common
graves, but the failure of the Revolution, the fall of Free
Russia.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>From the very first days of the Revolution a marked change
naturally took place in the attitude of the Russian Press. It
expressed itself on the one hand in a certain differentiation of all
the Bourgeois organs, which assumed a Liberal-Conservative
character, the <i>tactics</i> of which were adopted by an inconsiderable
part of the Socialist Press, of the type of Plekhanov&rsquo;s <i>Yedinstvo</i>;
and on the other in the appearance of an immense number of
Socialist organs.</p>

<p>The organs of the Right Wing underwent a considerable
evolution, a characteristic indication of which was the unexpected
declaration of a well-known member of the <i>Novoye Vremya</i> staff,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
Mr. Menshikov: &ldquo;We must be grateful to destiny that the
Monarchy, which for a thousand years has betrayed the people,
has at last betrayed itself and put a cross on its own grave. To
dig it up from under that cross and start a great dispute about the
candidates for the fallen throne would be, in my opinion, a fatal
mistake.&rdquo; In the course of the first few months the Right Press
partly closed down&mdash;not without pressure and violence on the part
of the Soviets&mdash;partly it assumed a pacific-Liberal attitude. It
was only in September, 1917, that its tone grew extremely violent
in connection with the final exposure of the weakness of the
Government, the loss of all hope of a legal way out of the &ldquo;no
thoroughfare&rdquo; which had arisen, and the echoes of Kornilov&rsquo;s
venture. The attacks of the extremist organs on the Government
passed into solid abuse of it.</p>

<p>Though differing in a greater or lesser degree in its understanding
of the social problems which the Revolution had to solve,
though guilty, perhaps, along with Russian society, of many mistakes,
yet the Russian Liberal Press showed an exceptional
unanimity in the more important questions of a constitutional and
national character: full power to the Provisional Government,
Democratic reforms in the spirit of the programme of March 2nd,<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
war until victory along with the Allies, an All-Russia Constituent
Assembly as the source of the supreme power and of the constitution
of the country. In yet another respect has the Liberal Press
left a good reputation behind it in history: in the days of lofty
popular enthusiasm, as in the days of doubt, vacillation and
general demoralisation, which distinguished the Revolutionary
period of 1917, no place was found in it, nor in the Right Press
either, for the distribution of German gold....</p>

<p>The appearance, on a large scale, of the new Socialist Press
was accompanied by a series of unfavourable circumstances. It
had no normal past, no traditions. Its prolonged life below the
surface, the exclusively destructive method of action adopted by
it, its suspicious and hostile attitude towards all authority, put a
certain stamp on the whole tendency of this Press, leaving too
little place and attention for creative work. The complete discord
in thought, the contradictions and vacillation which reigned
both within the Soviet and also among the party groups and
within the parties, were reflected in the Press, just as much as the
elemental pressure from below of irresistible, narrowly egotistic
class demands; for neglect of these demands gave rise to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
threat, which was once expressed by the &ldquo;beauty and pride of
the Revolution,&rdquo; the Kronstadt sailors to Tchernov, the
Minister: &ldquo;If you will not give us anything, Michael Alexandrovitch
will.&rdquo; Finally, the Press was not uninfluenced by the
appearance in it of a number of such persons as brought into it
an atmosphere of uncleanness and perfidy. The papers were full
of names, which had emerged from the sphere of crime, of the
Secret Police and of international espionage. All these gentlemen&mdash;Tchernomazov
(a provocator in the Secret Police and
director of the pre-Revolutionary <i>Pravda</i>), Berthold (the same and
also editor of the <i>Communist</i>), Dekonsky, Malinovsky, Matislavsky,
those colleagues of Lenin and Gorky&mdash;Nahamkes, Stoutchka,
Ouritsky, Gimmer (Soukhanov), and a vast number of equally
notorious names&mdash;brought the Russian Press to a hitherto
unknown degree of moral degradation.</p>

<p>The difference was only a matter of scope. Some papers,
akin to the Soviet semi-official organ, the <i>Izvestia of the Workmen&rsquo;s
and Soldiers&rsquo; Delegates</i>, undermined the country and the
Army, while others of the <i>Pravda</i> type (the organ of the Bolshevik
Social Democrats) broke them down.</p>

<p>At the same time as the <i>Izvestia</i> would call on its readers to
support the Provisional Government, while secretly ready to strike
a blow at it, the <i>Pravda</i> would declare that &ldquo;the Government is
counter-Revolutionary, and therefore there can be no relations
with it. The task of the Revolutionary Democracy is to attain
to the dictatorship of the proletariat.&rdquo; And Tchernov&rsquo;s Socialist
Revolutionary organ, the <i>Delo Naroda</i>, would discover a neutral
formula: all possible support to the Coalition Government, but
&ldquo;there is not, and cannot be, any unanimity in this question;
more than that, there must not be, in the interests of the double
defence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the same time as the <i>Izvestia</i> began to preach an advance,
but without a final victory, not abandoning, however, the intention
of &ldquo;deciding over the heads of the Government and the ruling
classes the conditions on which the War might be stopped,&rdquo; the
<i>Pravda</i> called for universal fraternisation, and the Socialist Revolutionary,
<i>Zemlia i Volia</i>, alternately grieved that Germany still
wished for conquest, or demanded a separate peace. Tchernov&rsquo;s
paper, which in March had considered that, &ldquo;should the enemy
be victorious, there would be an end to Russian freedom,&rdquo; now,
in May, saw in the preaching of an advance &ldquo;the limit of unblushing
gambling on the fate of the Fatherland, the limit of irresponsibility
and demagogy.&rdquo; Gorky&rsquo;s paper, <i>Novaya Zhizn</i>, speaking
through Gimmer (Soukhanov), rises to cynicism when it says:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
&ldquo;When Kerensky gives orders for <i>Russian soil to be cleared of
enemy troops</i>, his demands far exceed the limits of military <i>technique</i>.
He calls for a political act, one which has never been
provided for by the Coalition Government. For clearing the
country by an advance signifies &lsquo;complete victory&rsquo;....&rdquo; Altogether
the <i>Novaya Zhizn</i> supported German interests with especial
warmth, raising its voice in all cases when German interests were
threatened with danger, either on the part of the Allies or on
ours. And when the advance of the disorganised Army ended in
failure&mdash;in Tarnopol and Kalush&mdash;when Riga had fallen, the
Left Press started a bitter campaign against the Stavka and the
commanding personnel, and Tchernov&rsquo;s paper, in connection
with the proposed reforms in the Army, cried hysterically: &ldquo;Let
the proletarians know that it is proposed again to give them up
to the iron embrace of beggary, slavery and hunger....
Let the soldiers know that it is proposed again to enslave them
with the &lsquo;discipline&rsquo; of their commanders and to force them to
shed their blood without end, so long as the belief of the Allies
in Russia&rsquo;s &lsquo;gallantry&rsquo; is restored.&rdquo; The most straightforward
of all, however, was afterwards the <i>Iskra</i>, the organ of the Menshevist
Internationalists (Martov-Zederbaum), which, on the day
of the occupation of the island of Oesel by a German landing-party,
published an article entitled &ldquo;Welcome to the German
Fleet!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Army had its own military Press. The organs of the
Army staffs and of those at the Front, which used to appear before
the Revolution, were of the nature of purely military bulletins.
Beginning with the Revolution, these organs, with their weak
literary forces, began to fight for the existence of the Army, conscientiously,
honestly, but not cleverly. Meeting with indifference
or exasperation on the part of the soldiers, who had already turned
their backs on the officers, and especially on the part of the Committee
organs of the &ldquo;Revolutionary&rdquo; movement, which existed
side by side with them, they began to weaken and die out, until
at last, in the days of August, an order from Kerensky closed
them altogether; the exclusive right of publishing Army newspapers
was transferred to the Army Committee and the Committees
of the troops at the Front. The same fate befell the <i>News
of the Active Army</i>, the Stavka organ, started by General Markov
and left without support from the weighty powers of the Press of
the capital.</p>

<p>The Committee Press, widely spread among the troops at the
expense of the Government, reflected those moods of which I
have spoken earlier in the chapter on the Committees, ranging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
from Constitutionalism to Anarchism, from complete victory to
an immediate conclusion of peace, without orders. It reflected&mdash;but
in a worse, more sorry form, as regards literary style and
content&mdash;that disharmony of thought and those tendencies towards
extreme theories which characterised the Socialist Press of the
Capital. In this respect, in accordance with the personnel of the
Committees, and to some extent with their proximity to Petrograd,
the respective Fronts differed somewhat from one another.
The most moderate was the South-Western Front, somewhat
worse, the Western, while the Northern Front was pronouncedly
Bolshevist. Besides local talent, the columns of the Committee
Press were in many cases opened wide to the resolutions not only
of the extreme national parties, but even of the German parties.</p>

<p>It would be incorrect, however, to speak of the immediate
action of the Press on the masses of the soldiers. It did not exist
any more than there were any popular newspapers which these
masses could understand. The Press exercised an influence principally
on the semi-educated elements in the ranks of the Army.
This sphere turned out to be nearer to the soldiers, and to it
passed a certain share of that authority which was enjoyed earlier
by the officers. Ideas gathered from the papers and refracted
through the mental prism of this class passed in a simplified form
to the soldiery, the vast majority of which unfortunately consisted
of ignorant and illiterate men. And among these masses all
these conceptions, stripped of cunningly-woven arguments,
premises and grounds, were transformed into wondrously simple
and terrifically logical conclusions.</p>

<p>In them dominated the straightforward negation: &ldquo;Down!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Down with the Bourgeois Government, down with the counter-Revolutionary
Commanders, down with the &ldquo;sanguinary
slaughter,&rdquo; down with everything of which they were sick, of
which they were wearied, all that in one way or another interfered
with their animal instincts and hampered &ldquo;free will&rdquo;&mdash;down with
them all!</p>

<p>In such an elementary fashion did the Army at innumerable
soldiers&rsquo; meetings settle all the political and social questions that
were agitating mankind.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The curtain has fallen. The Treaty of Versailles has for a
time given pause to the armed conflict in Central Europe.
Evident to the end that, having regained their strength, the
nations may again take up their arms, so as to burst the chains
in which defeat has fettered them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span></p>

<p>The idea of the &ldquo;world-peace,&rdquo; which the Christian churches
have been preaching for twenty centuries, is buried for years to
come.</p>

<p>To us, how childishly naÃ¯ve now seem the efforts of the
humanists of the nineteenth century, who by prolonged, ardent
propaganda sought to soften the horrors of war and to introduce
the limiting norms of International Law! Yes, now, when we
know that one may not only infringe the neutrality of a peaceful,
cultured country, but give it to be ravaged and plundered; when
we can sink peaceable ships, with women and children on board,
by means of submarines; poison people with suffocating gases and
tear their bodies with the fragments of explosive bullets; when a
whole country, a whole nation, is quoted by cold, political
calculation merely as a &ldquo;Barrier&rdquo; against the invasion of armed
force and pernicious ideas, and is periodically either helped or
betrayed in turn.</p>

<p>But the most terrible of all weapons ever invented by the mind
of man, the most shameful of all the methods permitted in the
late World War was <i>the poisoning of the soul of a people</i>!</p>

<p>Germany assigns the priority of this invention to Great Britain.
Let them settle this matter between themselves. But I see my
native land crushed, dying in the dark night of horror and insanity.
And I know her tormentors.</p>

<p>Two theses have arisen before mankind in all their grim power
and all their shameless nakedness:</p>

<p><i>All is permissible for the advantage of one&rsquo;s country!</i></p>

<p><i>All is permissible for the triumph of one&rsquo;s party, one&rsquo;s class!</i></p>

<p>All, even the moral and physical ruin of an enemy country,
even the betrayal of one&rsquo;s native land and the making on its
living body of <i>social experiments</i>, the failure of which threatens
it with paralysis and death.</p>

<p>Germany and Lenin unhesitatingly decided these questions in
the affirmative. The world has condemned them; but are
all those who speak of the matter so unanimous and sincere
in their condemnation? Have not these ideas left somewhat too
deep traces in the minds, not so much perhaps of the popular
masses as of their leaders? I, at least, am led to such a conclusion
by all the present soulless world policy of the Governments,
especially towards Russia, by all the present utterly selfish tactics
of the class organisations.</p>

<p>This is terrible.</p>

<p>I believe that every people has the right to defend its existence,
sword in hand; I know that for many years to come war will
be the customary method of settling international disputes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
and that methods of warfare will be both honourable and, alas!
dishonourable. But there is a certain limit, beyond which even
baseness ceases to be simply baseness and becomes insanity. This
limit we have already reached. And if religion, science, literature,
philosophers, humanitarians, teachers of mankind do not arouse
a broad, idealistic movement against the Hottentot morality with
which we have been inoculated, the world will witness the decline
of its civilisation.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII.</a><br />
<span class="smcap">The Condition of the Army at the July Advance.</span></h2>

<p>Having outlined a whole series of conditions which exercised
an influence on the life, spirit, and military efficiency
of the once famous Russian Army, I shall now pass to the sorrowful
tale of its fall.</p>

<p>I was born in the family of an officer of the line, and for twenty-two
years (including the two years of the Russo-Japanese War)
before the European War served in the ranks of modest line units
and in small Army Staffs. I shared the life, the joys and the sorrows
of the officer and the soldier, and devoted many pages in the
Military Press to their life which was my own. From 1914 to 1920,
almost without interval, I stood at the head of the troops and led
them into battle on the fields of White Russia, Volynia, Galicia,
in the mountains of Hungary, in Roumania, and then&mdash;then in the
bitter internecine war which, with bloody share, ploughed up our
native land.</p>

<p>I have more grounds and more right to speak of the Army and
in the name of the Army than all those strangers of the Socialist
Camp, who, in their haughty self-conceit, as soon as they touched
the Army, began breaking down its foundations, judging its
leaders and fighters and diagnosing its serious disease, who even
now, after grievous experiments and experiences, have not given
up the hope of transforming this mighty and terrible weapon of
national self-preservation into a means for satisfying party and
social appetites. For me, the Army is not only an historical,
social, national phenomenon, but nearly the whole of my life, in
which lie many memories, precious and not to be forgotten, in
which all is bound up and interlaced into one general mass of
swiftly passing days of sadness and of joy, in which there are
hundreds of cherished graves, of buried dreams and unextinguishable
faith.</p>

<p>The Army should be approached cautiously, never forgetting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
that not only its historical foundations, but even such details of its
life as may, perhaps, seem strange and absurd, have their meaning
and significance.</p>

<p>When the Revolution began that old veteran, beloved by
both officers and soldiers, General P. I. Mishtchenko, being
unable to put up with the new rÃ©gime, retired from the Army. He
lived at Temir-Han Shoura, never went outside his garden fence,
and always wore his General&rsquo;s uniform and his crosses of St.
George, even in the days of Bolshevik power. One day the
Bolsheviks came to search his house, and, among other things,
wanted to deprive him of his shoulder straps and decorations. The
old General retired to a neighbouring room and shot himself.</p>

<p>Let whoever will laugh at &ldquo;old-fashioned prejudices.&rdquo; We
shall reverence his noble memory.</p>

<p>And so the storm-cloud of the Revolution broke.</p>

<p>There was no doubt whatever that such a cataclysm in the life of
the nation could not but have a grave effect. The Revolution was
<i>bound</i> to convulse the Army, greatly weakening and breaking all
its historic ties. Such a result was normal, natural and unavoidable,
independently of the condition of the Army at the moment,
independently of the mutual relations of Commanders and
subordinates. We can speak only of the circumstances which
arrested or hastened the disintegration of the Army.</p>

<p>A Government appeared.</p>

<p>Its source might have been one of three elements: The High
Command (a military dictatorship), the Bourgeois State Duma (the
Provisional Government), or the Revolutionary Democracy (the
Soviet). It was the Provisional Government that was acknowledged.
The attitude of the other two elements towards it was
different; the Soviet practically robbed the Government of its
power, while the High Command submitted to it implicitly, and
was therefore obliged to carry out its plans.</p>

<p>The Government had two courses open to it; it could combat
the disintegrating influences which began to appear in the Army by
stern and ruthless measures, or it could encourage them. Owing
to pressure from the Soviet and partly through want of firmness
and through misunderstanding of the laws of existence of armed
forces, the Government chose the second course.</p>

<p>This circumstance decided the fate of the Army. All other
circumstances could but influence the duration of the process of
disruption and its depth.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p><b>Types of soldiers of the Old Army.</b> This company was sent to the West European Front.</p></div>

<p>The festive days of touching and joyous union between the
officers and the soldiers vanished rapidly, being replaced by tiresome,
weary week-days. But they had been in the past, those days<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
of joy, and, therefore, no impassable abyss existed between the
two Ranks, over which the inexorable logic of life had long been
casting a bridge. The unnecessary, obsolete methods, which had
introduced an element of irritation into the soldiery, fell away at
once, as of themselves; the officers became more thoughtful and
industrious.</p>

<p>Then came a torrent of newspapers, appeals, resolutions,
orders, from some unknown authority, and with them a whole
series of new ideas, which the soldier masses were unable to digest
and assimilate. New people appeared, with a new speech, so
fascinating and promising, liberating the soldiers from obedience
and inspiring hope that they would be saved from deadly danger
immediately. When one Regimental Commander naÃ¯vely inquired
whether these people might not be tried by Field Court-Martial
and shot, his telegram, after passing through all official stages,
called forth the reply from Petrograd that these people were
inviolable, and had been sent by the Soviet to the troops for the
very purpose of explaining to them the true meaning of current
events.</p>

<p>When such leaders of the Revolutionary Democracy, as have
not yet lost their feeling of responsibility for crucified Russia, now
say that the movement, caused by the deep class differences between
the officers and the soldiers and by &ldquo;the enslavement&rdquo; of the
latter, was of an elemental nature, which they could not resist, this
is deeply untrue.</p>

<p>All the fundamental slogans, all the programmes, tactics,
instructions and text-books, forming the foundation of the
&ldquo;democratisation&rdquo; of the Army, had been drawn up by the
military sections of the secret Socialist parties long before the
War, outside of &ldquo;elemental&rdquo; pressure, on the grounds of clear,
cold calculation, as a product of &ldquo;Socialist reasoning and
conscience.&rdquo;</p>

<p>True, the officers strove to persuade the men not to believe
the &ldquo;new words&rdquo; and to do their duty. But from the very
beginning the Soviets had declared the officers to be foes of the
Revolution; in many towns they had been subjected to cruel torture
and death, and this with impunity. Evidently not without some
reason, when even the &ldquo;Bourgeois&rdquo; Duma issued such a strange
and unexpected &ldquo;announcement&rdquo; as the following: &ldquo;This first
day of March, rumours were spread among the soldiers of the
garrison of Petrograd to the effect that the officers in the regiments
were disarming the soldiers. These rumours were
investigated and found to be false. As President of the
Military Commission of the Provisional Committee of the State<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
Duma, I declare that the most decided measures <i>will be</i> taken to
prevent such action on the part of the officers, up to the shooting
of those guilty of it. Signed, <span class="smcap">Colonel Engelhardt</span>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Next came Order No. 1., the Declaration and so forth.</p>

<p>Perhaps, however, it might have been possible to combat all
this verbal ocean of lies and hypocrisy which flowed from
Petrograd and from the local Soviets and was echoed by the local
demagogues had it not been for a circumstance which paralysed all
the efforts of the Commanders, viz., the animal feeling of self-preservation
which had flooded the whole mass of the soldiers.
This feeling had always existed. But it had been kept under
and restrained by examples of duty fulfilled, by flashes of national
self-consciousness, by shame, fear and pressure. When all these
elements had disappeared, when for the soothing of a drowsy
conscience there was a whole arsenal of new conceptions, which
justified the care for one&rsquo;s own hide and furnished it with an ideal
basis, then the Army could exist no longer. This feeling upset
all the efforts of the Commanders, all moral principles and the
whole regiment of the Army.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In a large, open field, as far as the eye can see, run endless
lines of trenches, sometimes coming close up to each other, interlacing
their barbed wire fences, sometimes running far off and
vanishing behind a verdant crest. The sun has risen long ago,
but it is still as death in the field. The first to rise are the
Germans. In one place and another their figures look out from
the trenches; a few come out on to the parapet to hang their
clothes, damp after the night, in the sun. A sentry in our front
trench opens his sleepy eyes, lazily stretches himself, after looking
indifferently at the enemy trenches. A soldier in a dirty shirt,
bare-footed, with coat slung over his shoulders, cringing under
the morning cold, comes out of his trench and plods towards the
German positions, where, between the lines, stands a &ldquo;postbox&rdquo;;
it contains a new number of the German paper, <i>The
Russian Messenger</i>, and proposals for barter.</p>

<p>All is still. Not a single gun is to be heard. Last week the
Regimental Committee issued a resolution against firing, even
against distance firing; let the necessary distances be estimated by
the map. A Lieutenant-Colonel of the gunners&mdash;a member of the
Committee&mdash;gave his full approval to this resolution. When
yesterday the Commander of a field battery began firing at a new
enemy trench, our infantry opened rifle fire on our observation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
post and wounded the telephone operator. During the night the
infantry lit a fire on the position being constructed for a newly
arrived heavy battery.<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>Nine a.m. The first Company gradually begins to awaken.
The trenches are incredibly defiled; in the narrow communication
trenches and those of the second line the air is thick and close.
The parapet is crumbling away. No one troubles to repair it; no
one feels inclined to do so, and there are not enough men in the
Company. There is a large number of deserters; more than fifty
have been allowed to go. Old soldiers have been demobilised,
others have gone on leave with the arbitrary permission of the
Committee. Others, again, have been elected members of
numerous Committees, or gone away as delegates; a while ago,
for instance, the Division sent a numerous delegation to &ldquo;Comrade&rdquo;
Kerensky to verify whether he had really given orders
for an advance. Finally, by threats and violence, the soldiers have
so terrorised the regimental surgeons that the latter have been
issuing medical certificates even to the &ldquo;thoroughly fit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the trenches the hours pass slowly and wearily, in dullness
and idleness. In one corner men are playing cards, in another a
soldier returned from leave is lazily and listlessly telling a story;
the air is full of obscene swearing. Someone reads aloud from
the <i>Russian Messenger</i> the following:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The English want the Russians to shed the last drop of their
blood for the greater glory of England, who seeks her profit in
everything.... Dear soldiers, you must know that Russia
would have concluded peace long ago had not England prevented
her.... We must turn away from her&mdash;the Russian people
demand it; such is their sacred will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Someone or other swears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you wish for peace. <i>They</i> make peace, the &mdash;&mdash;;
we shall die here, without getting our freedom!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Along the trenches came Lieutenant Albov, the Company
Commander. He said to the groups of soldiers, somewhat
irresolutely and entreatingly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Comrades, get to work quickly. In three days we have
not made a single communication trench to the firing line.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The card players did not even look round; someone said in a
low voice, &ldquo;All right.&rdquo; The man reading the newspaper rose
and reported, in a free and easy manner:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;The Company does not want to dig, because that would
be preparation for an advance, and the Committee has
resolved....&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here, you understand nothing at all about it, and,
moreover, why do you speak for the whole Company? Even if we
remain on the defensive we are lost in case of an alarm; the whole
Company cannot get out to the firing line along a single
trench.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He said this, and with a gesture of despair went on his way.
Matters were hopeless. Every time he tried to speak with them
for a time, and in a friendly way, they would listen to him attentively;
they liked to talk to him, and, on the whole, his Company
looked on him favourably in their own way. But he felt that
between him and them a wall had sprung up, against which all his
good impulses were shattered. He had lost the path to their soul&mdash;lost
it in the impassable jungle of darkness, roughness, and that
wave of distrust and suspicion which had overwhelmed the soldiers.
Was it, perhaps, that he used the wrong words, or was not
able to say what he meant? Scarcely that. But a little while
before the War, when he was a student and was carried away by
the popular movement, he had visited villages and factories and
had found &ldquo;real words&rdquo; which were clear and comprehensible
to all. But, most of all, with what words can one move men to
face death when all their feelings are veiled by one feeling&mdash;that
of self-preservation?</p>

<p>The train of his thoughts was broken by the sudden appearance
of the Regimental Commander.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What the devil does this mean? The man on duty does not
come forward. The men are not dressed. Filth and stench.
What are you about, Lieutenant?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The grey-headed Colonel cast a stern glance on the soldiers
which involuntarily impressed them. They all rose to their feet.
He glanced through a loop-hole and, starting back, asked
nervously:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the green field, among the barbed wire, a regular bazaar was
going on. A group of Germans and of our men were bartering
vodka, tobacco, lard, bread. Some way off a German officer
reclined on the grass&mdash;red-faced, sturdy, with an arrogant look on
his face&mdash;and carried on a conversation with a soldier named
Soloveytchick; and, strange to say, the familiar and insolent
Soloveytchick stood before the Lieutenant respectfully.</p>

<p>The Colonel pushed the observer aside and, taking his rifle
from him, put it through the loop-hole. A murmur was heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
among the soldiers. They began to ask him not to shoot. One
of them, in a low voice, as if speaking to himself, remarked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is provocation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Colonel, crimson with fury, turned to him for a moment
and shouted:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Silence!&rdquo;</p>

<p>All grew silent and pressed to the loop-hole. A shot was heard,
and the German officer convulsively stretched himself out and was
still; blood was running from his head. The haggling soldiers
scattered.</p>

<p>The Colonel threw the rifle down and, muttering through his
teeth &ldquo;Scoundrels!&rdquo; strode further along the trenches. The
&ldquo;truce&rdquo; was infringed.</p>

<p>The Lieutenant went off to his hut. His heart was sad and
empty. He was oppressed by the realisation of his unwantedness
and uselessness in these absurd surroundings, which perverted the
whole meaning of that service to his country, which alone justified
all his grave troubles and the death which might perhaps be near.
He threw himself on his bed, where he lay for an hour, for two
hours, striving to think of nothing, to forget himself.</p>

<p>But from beyond the mud wall, where the shelter lay, there
crept someone&rsquo;s muffled voice, which seemed to wrap his brain
in a filthy fog:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is all very well for them, the &mdash;&mdash;. They receive their
hundred and forty roubles a month clear, while we&mdash;so generous
of them&mdash;get seven and a half. Wait a bit, our turn will come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hear they are sharing the land in our place in the province
of Kharkov. If I could only get home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a knock at the door. The Sergeant-Major had
come.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your honour (so he always addressed his Company Commander
in the absence of witnesses), the Company is angry, and
threatens to leave the position if it is not relieved at once. The
Second Battalion should have relieved us at five o&rsquo;clock, and it is
not here yet. Couldn&rsquo;t they be rung up?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They will not go away. All right, I shall inquire; but, all
the same, it is too late now. After this morning&rsquo;s incident the
Germans will not allow us to be relieved by day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They will allow us. The Committee members know about
it already. I think&rdquo;&mdash;he lowered his voice&mdash;&ldquo;that Soloveytchick
has managed to slip across and explain matters. It is rumoured
that the Germans have promised to overlook it, on condition that
next time the Colonel comes to visit the trenches we should let<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
them know, and they will throw a bomb. You had better report
it or else, who knows?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Sergeant-Major was preparing to leave. The Lieutenant
stopped him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Matters are bad, Petrovitch. They do not trust us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;God alone knows whom they trust; only last week the Sixth
Company elected their Sergeant-Major themselves, and now they
are making a mock of him; they won&rsquo;t let him say a word.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What will things be afterwards?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Sergeant-Major blushed, and said softly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then the Soloveytchicks will rule over us, and we shall be,
so to speak, dumb animals before them&mdash;that is how matters will
be, your honour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The relief came at last. Captain Bouravin, the Commander
of the Fifth Company, came into the hut. Albov offered to show
him the section and explain the disposition of the enemy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, though that does not matter, because I am not
really in command of the Company&mdash;I am boycotted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just so. They have elected the 2nd Lieutenant, my subaltern,
as Company Commander, and degraded me as a supporter of the
old rÃ©gime, because, you see, I had drill twice a day&mdash;you know
that the marching contingents come up here absolutely untrained.
Indeed, the 2nd Lieutenant was the first to vote for my removal.
&lsquo;We have been slave-driven long enough,&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;Now we are
free. We must clean out everyone, beginning with the head. A
young man can manage the regiment just as well, so long as he
is a true Democrat and supports the freedom of the soldier.&rsquo; I
would have left, but the Colonel flatly refused to allow it, and
forbids me to hand over the company. So now, you see, we have
two commanders. I have stood the situation for five days. Look
here, Albov, you are not in a hurry, are you? Very good, then;
let us have a chat. I am feeling depressed. Albov, have you not
yet thought of suicide?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not as yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bouravin rose to his feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Understand me, they have desecrated my soul, outraged
my human dignity, and so every day, every hour, in every word,
glance or gesture one sees a constant outrage. What have I
done to them? I have been in the service for eight years; I have
no family, no house or home. All this I have found in the regiment,
my own regiment. Twice I have been badly wounded,
and before my wounds were healed have rushed back to the regi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>ment&mdash;so
there you are! And I loved the soldier&mdash;I am ashamed
to speak of it myself, but they must remember how, more than
once, I have crept out under the barbed wire to drag in
the wounded. And now! Well, yes, I reverence the regimental
flag and hate their crimson rags. I accept the Revolution.
But to me Russia is infinitely dearer than the Revolution. All
these Committees and meetings, all this adventitious rubbish
which has been sown in the Army I am organically unable to
swallow and digest. But, after all, I interfere with no one; I
say nothing of this to anyone, I strive to convince no one. If
only the War could be ended honourably, and then I am ready to
break stones on the highway, only not to remain in an Army
democratised in such a manner. Take my subaltern; he discusses
everything with them&mdash;nationalisation, socialisation, labour control.
Now I cannot do so&mdash;I never had time to study it, and I
confess I never took any interest in the matter. You remember
how the Army Commander came here and, amidst a crowd
of soldiers, said: &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t say &ldquo;General&rdquo;; call me simply
Comrade George.&rsquo; Now I cannot do such things; besides,
all the same, they would not believe me. So I am silent. But
they understand and pay me off. And, you know, with all their
ignorance, what subtle psychologists they are! They are able
to find the place where the sting hurts most. Now, yesterday
for instance....&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stooped down to Albov&rsquo;s ear, and continued in a whisper:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I returned from our mess. In my tent, at the head of my
bed, I have a photograph&mdash;well, just a treasured memory. There
they had drawn an obscenity!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bouravin rose and wiped his brow with his handkerchief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, let us take a look at the positions. God willing, we
shall not have to stand it long. No one in the Company wants
to go scouting. I go myself every night; sometimes there is a
volunteer who accompanies me&mdash;he has a hunter&rsquo;s strain in him.
Should anything happen, please, Albov, see to it that a little
packet&mdash;it is in my bag&mdash;is sent to its destination.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The company, without waiting for the completion of the relief,
wandered away in disorder. Albov plodded after them.</p>

<p>The communication trench ended in a broad hollow. Like a
great ant-hill the regimental bivouac stretched in rows of huts,
tents, smoking camp-kitchens and horse-lines. They had once
been carefully masked by artificial plantations, which had now
withered, lost their leaves, and were merely leafless poles. On
an open green soldiers were drilling here and there&mdash;listlessly,
lazily, as if to create an impression that they were doing some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>thing;
after all, it would be awkward to be doing absolutely
nothing at all. There were few officers about; the good ones
were sick of the trivial farce into which real work was now transformed,
while the inferior ones had a moral justification for their
laziness and idleness. In the distance something between a mob
and a column marched along the road towards the regimental
staff quarters, carrying crimson flags. Before them went a huge
banner bearing the inscription, in white letters, visible in the
distance: &ldquo;Down with War!&rdquo;</p>

<p>These were reinforcements coming up. At once, all the
soldiers drilling on the green, as if at a signal, broke their ranks
and ran towards the column.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey, countrymen! What province are you from?&rdquo;</p>

<p>An animated conversation began on the usual anxious
themes: how did matters stand with the land; would peace
be concluded soon? Much interest, also, was shown in the question
as to whether they had brought any home-brewed spirits,
as &ldquo;their own regimental&rdquo; home brew, manufactured in fairly
large quantities at &ldquo;the distillery&rdquo; of the Third Battalion, was
very disgusting, and gave rise to painful symptoms.</p>

<p>Albov made his way to the mess-room. The officers were
gathering for dinner. What had become of the former animation,
friendly talk, healthy laughter and torrents of reminiscences
of a stormy, hard, but glorious life of war? The reminiscences
had faded, the dreams had flown away, and stern reality crushed
them all down with its weight.</p>

<p>They spoke in low voices, sometimes breaking off or expressing
themselves figuratively: the mess servants might denounce
them, and also new faces had appeared among themselves. Not
so long ago the Regimental Committee, on the report of a servant,
had tried an officer of the regiment, who wore the Cross of
St. George and to whom the regiment owed one of its most famous
victories. This Lieutenant-Colonel had said something about
&ldquo;mutinous slaves.&rdquo; And though it was proved that those were
not his own words and that he had only quoted a speech made by
Comrade Kerensky, the Committee &ldquo;expressed its indignation
at him&rdquo;; he had to leave the regiment.</p>

<p>The personnel of the officers, too, was much changed. Of
the original staff, some two or three remained. Some had
perished, others had been crippled, others again, having earned
&ldquo;distrust,&rdquo; were wandering about the Front, importuning Staffs,
joining shock battalions, entering institutions in the rear, while
some of the weaker brethren had simply gone home. The Army
had ceased to need the bearers of the traditions of its units, of its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
former glory&mdash;of those old Bourgeois prejudices, which had been
swept into the dust by the Revolutionary creative power.</p>

<p>Everyone in the regiment knows already of that morning&rsquo;s
event in Albov&rsquo;s Company. He is questioned about details. A
Lieutenant-Colonel sitting next him wagged his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well done, our old man. There was something in the Fifth
Company, too. But I am afraid it will end badly. Have you
heard what was done to the Commander of the Doubov Regiment,
because he refused to confirm an elected Company Commander
and put three agitators under arrest? <i>He was crucified.</i>
Yes, my boy! They nailed him to a tree and began, in turn, to
stick their bayonets into him, to cut off his ears, his nose, his
fingers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He seized his head in his hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My God! Where do these men get so much brutality, so
much baseness?&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the other end of the table the ensigns are carrying on a
conversation on that ever harassing theme&mdash;where to get away to.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you applied for admission to the Revolutionary
Battalion?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, it is not worth while. It seems that it is being formed
under the superintendence of the Executive Committee, with
Committees, elections and &ldquo;Revolutionary&rdquo; discipline. It does
not suit me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They say that shock units are being formed in Kornilov&rsquo;s
Army and at Minsk also. That would be good....&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have applied for transfer to our rifle brigade in France.
Only I do not know what I am to do about the language.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alas! my boy, you are too late,&rdquo; remarked the Lieutenant-Colonel
from the other end of the table. &ldquo;The Government has
long ago sent &lsquo;emigrant comrades&rsquo; there to enlighten minds.
And now our brigades, somewhere in the South of France, are
in the situation of something like either prisoners of war or
disciplinary battalions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This talk, however, was realised by all to be of a purely platonic
character, in view of the hopelessness of a situation from which
there was no escape. It was only a case of dreaming a little, as
Tchekhov&rsquo;s <i>Three Sisters</i> once dreamed of Moscow. Dreaming
of such a wondrous place, where human dignity is not trampled
into the mud daily, where one can live quietly and die honourably,
without violence and without outrage to one&rsquo;s service. Such a
very little thing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mitka, bread!&rdquo; boomed out the mighty bass of 2nd Lieutenant
Yassny.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span></p>

<p>He is quite a character, this Yassny. Tall and sturdy, with a
thick crop of hair and a copper-coloured beard, he is altogether
an embodiment of the strength and courage of the soil. He
wears four crosses of St. George, and has been promoted from
the rank of Sergeant for distinction in action. He does not adapt
himself to his new surroundings in the least, said &ldquo;levorution&rdquo;
for &ldquo;revolution&rdquo; and &ldquo;mettink&rdquo; for &ldquo;meeting,&rdquo; and cannot
reconcile himself to the new order. Yassny&rsquo;s undoubted
&ldquo;democratic&rdquo; views, his candour and sincerity, have given him
an exceptionally privileged position in the regiment. Without
enjoying any special influence, he can, however, condemn, rudely,
harshly, sometimes with an oath, both people and ideas, which
are jealously guarded and worshipped by the regimental
&ldquo;Revolutionary Democracy.&rdquo; The men are angry, but suffer
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no bread, I say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The officers, absorbed in their thoughts and in their conversation,
had not even noticed that they had eaten their soup without
bread.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There will be no bread to-day,&rdquo; answered the waiter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the meaning of this? Call the mess-sergeant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The mess-sergeant came, and began to justify himself in a
bewildered manner; he had sent in a request that morning
for two pouds of bread. The head of the Commissariat
had endorsed it &ldquo;to be issued,&rdquo; but the clerk, Fedotov, a
member of the Commissariat Committee, had endorsed it in his
turn &ldquo;not to be issued.&rdquo; So the storehouse would not issue any
bread.</p>

<p>No one made any objection, so painfully ashamed was everyone
both of the mess-sergeant and of those depths of inanity which
had suddenly broken into their life and swamped it with a grey,
filthy slime. Only Yassny&rsquo;s bass voice rang out distinctly under
the arches of the mess-room:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What swine!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Albov was just preparing for a nap after dinner when the flap
of his tent was lifted, and through the aperture appeared the bald
head of the Chief of the Commissariat&mdash;a quiet, elderly Colonel,
who had joined the Army again from the retired list.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I come in?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon, Colonel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind, my dear fellow, don&rsquo;t get up. I have just come
in for a second. You see, to-day at six o&rsquo;clock there is to be a
regimental meeting. It will hear the Report of the Committee for
verifying the Commissariat, and apparently they will go for me.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
I am no speech-maker, but you are a master of it. Take my part,
should it be necessary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly. I did not intend going, but once it is necessary, I
shall be there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, then, my dear fellow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>By six o&rsquo;clock the square next to the regimental Staff quarters
was completely covered with men. At least two thousand had
turned up. The crowd moved, chattered, laughed&mdash;just such a
Russian crowd as on the Khodynka in Moscow or the <i>Champs de
Mars</i> in Petrograd at a holiday entertainment. The Revolution
could not transform it all at once, either mentally or spiritually.
But, having stunned it with a torrent of new words and opened
up before it unbounded possibilities, the Revolution had destroyed
its equilibrium and made it nervously susceptible and stormily
reactive to all methods of external influence. An ocean of words&mdash;both
morally lofty and basely criminal&mdash;flowed through their
minds as through a sieve, which passed through the trend
of the new ideas and retained only those grains which had a
real applied meaning in their daily life, in the surroundings
of the soldier, the peasant, the workman. Hence the absolute
absence of results from the torrents of eloquence which flooded
the Army at the instance of the Minister of War; hence, too, the
illogical warm sympathy with both speakers of clearly opposed
politics.</p>

<p>Under such conditions, what practical meaning could the crowd
find in such ideas as duty, honour, interests of the State, on the
one hand; annexations, indemnities, the self-determination of
peoples, conscious discipline, and other dim conceptions on the
other.</p>

<p>The whole regiment had turned out; the soldiers were
attracted by the meeting, as by any other spectacle. Delegates
had been sent by the Second Battalion, which was in the trenches&mdash;about
one-third of the battalion. In the middle of the square stood
a platform for the speakers; it was decorated with red flags, faded
with time and rain; they have been there since the platform was
erected for a review by the Commander of the Army. Reviews
are now held not among the ranks, but from a tribune. To-day
the agenda of the meeting contain two questions: &ldquo;(1) The
Report of the Commissariat Committee on the anomalies in the
supply of Officers&rsquo; rations; and (2) the report of Comrade
Sklianka, an orator specially invited from the Moscow Soviet to
speak about the formation of a Coalition Ministry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>During the preceding week a stormy meeting, which nearly
ended in a riot, had been held in connection with the complaint<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
of one of the companies that the soldiers had to eat lentils, which
they hated, and thin soup, simply because all the groats and
butter were taken for the officers&rsquo; mess. This was clearly nonsense.
Nevertheless, it was resolved to appoint a Committee for
investigation, which would report to a general meeting of the
regiment. The Report was drawn up by a member of the Committee,
Lieutenant-Colonel Petrov, who had been removed the
year before from the post of Chief of the Commissariat and was
now settling accounts with his successor. In a petty, cavilling
way, with a sort of mean irony, he enumerated slight, irrelevant,
inaccuracies in the Commissariat Department of the regiment&mdash;there
were no serious ones&mdash;and dragged out his Report endlessly
in his creaking, monotonous voice. The crowd, which at first had
kept quiet, now hummed again, having ceased to listen. From
different sides voices were heard:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Enough!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That will do!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Chairman of the Commission ceased reading and suggested
that &ldquo;those comrades who wished&rdquo; should express their
opinions. A tall, stout soldier ascended the platform, and began
speaking in a loud, hysterical voice:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Comrades, you have heard? That is where the soldiers&rsquo; property
goes. We suffer, our clothes are worn out, we are covered
with lice, we go hungry, while they pull the last piece of food out
of our mouths.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As he spoke a spirit of nervous excitement kept growing in
the crowd, muffled murmurs ran through it, and shouts of approval
burst from it here and there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When will there be an end to all this? We are worn out,
weary to death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly 2nd Lieut. Yassny&rsquo;s deep voice was heard from
the rear ranks, drowning the voices both of the speaker and of the
crowd.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is your Company?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Some confusion took place. The orator was dumb. Shouts
of indignation were flung at Yassny.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is your Company, I ask you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Seventh!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Voices were heard in the ranks:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have no such man in the Seventh Company.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait a bit, my friend,&rdquo; boomed Yassny, &ldquo;was it not you
that came in to-day with the new lot ... you were carrying
a large placard? When have you had time to get worn out, poor
fellow?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span></p>

<p>The spirit of the crowd changed in an instant. It began to
hiss, laugh, shout, and crack jokes. The unsuccessful orator
disappeared in the crowd. Someone shouted:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pass a resolution!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lieutenant-Colonel Petrov mounted the platform again, and
began to read out a ready resolution for transferring the officers&rsquo;
mess to privates&rsquo; rations. But no one listened to him now. Two
or three voices shouted &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right!&rdquo; Petrov hesitated a
little, then put the paper in his pocket and left the platform. The
second question, concerning the removal of the Chief of the Commissariat
and the immediate election of his successor (the author
of the report was the candidate proposed) remained unread. The
Chairman of the Committee then announced:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Comrade Sklianka, member of the Executive Committee of
the Moscow Council of Workmen&rsquo;s and Soldiers&rsquo; Delegates, will
now address the meeting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They were tired of their own speakers&mdash;it was always one and
the same thing&mdash;and the arrival of a new man, somewhat advertised
by the Committee, aroused general interest. The crowd
closed up round the platform and was still. A small, black-haired
man, nervous and short-sighted, who constantly adjusted the eyeglasses
which kept slipping off his nose, mounted the platform, or
rather quickly ran up on to it. He began speaking rapidly, with
much spirit and much gesticulation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Soldier comrades! Three months have passed already since
the Petrograd workers and Revolutionary soldiers threw off the
yoke of the Czar and of all his Generals. The Bourgeoisie, in the
person of Tereshtchenko, the well-known sugar refiner; Konovalov,
the factory owner; the landowners, Gutchkov, Rodzianko,
Miliukov, and other traitors to the interests of the people, having
seized the supreme power, have tried to deceive the popular
masses.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The demand of the people that negotiations be commenced
at once for that peace which we are offered by our German worker
and soldier brethren&mdash;who are just as much bereft of all that makes
life worth living as we are&mdash;has ended in a fraud&mdash;a telegram from
Miliukov to England and France to say that the Russian people
are ready to fight until victory is attained.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The unfortunate people understood that the supreme power
had fallen into even worse hands, <i>i.e.</i>, into those of the sworn
foes of the workman and the peasant. Therefore the people
shouted mightily: &lsquo;Down with you, hands off!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the accursed Bourgeoisie shook at the mighty cry of the
workers and hypocritically invited to a share in their power the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
so-called Democracy&mdash;the Socialist-Revolutionaries and the Mensheviks,
who always associated with the Bourgeoisie for the
betrayal of the interests of the working people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Having thus outlined the process of the formation of the
Coalition Ministry, Comrade Sklianka passed in greater detail to
the fascinating prospects of rural and factory anarchy, where
&ldquo;the wrath of the people sweeps away the yoke of capital&rdquo; and
where &ldquo;Bourgeois property gradually passes into the hands of its
real masters&mdash;the workmen and the poorer peasants.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The soldiers and the workmen still have enemies,&rdquo; he continued.
&ldquo;These are the friends of the overthrown Czarist
Government, the hardened admirers of shooting, the knout, and
blows. The most bitter foes of freedom, they have now donned
crimson rosettes, call you &lsquo;comrades&rsquo; and pretend to be friends,
but cherish the blackest intentions in their hearts, preparing to
restore the rule of the Romanovs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Soldiers, do not trust these wolves in sheep&rsquo;s clothing!
They call you to fresh slaughter. Well, follow them if you like!
Let them pave the path for the return of the bloody Czar with
your corpses. Let your orphans, your widows and children,
deserted by all, pass again into slavery, hunger, beggary, and
disease!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The speech undoubtedly had a great success. The atmosphere
grew red-hot, the excitement increased&mdash;that excitement of the
&ldquo;molten mass,&rdquo; in the presence of which it is impossible to foresee
either the limits or the tension, or the tracks along which the
torrent will pour. The crowd was noisy and agitated, accompanying
with shouts of approval or curses against &ldquo;the enemies of
the people&rdquo; those parts of the speech which especially touched its
instincts, its naked, cruel egotism.</p>

<p>Albov, pale, with burning eyes, made his appearance on the
platform. He spoke excitedly of something or other to the
chairman, who then addressed the crowd. The chairman&rsquo;s words
were inaudible amidst the noise; for a long time he waved his hands
and the flag which he had pulled down, until at last the noise had
subsided somewhat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Comrades, Lieutenant Albov wishes to address you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Shouts and hisses were heard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Down with him! We do not want him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Albov was already on the platform, gripping hard, bending
downwards towards the sea of heads. And he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I will speak, and you dare not refuse to listen to one
of those officers whom this man has been abusing and dishonouring
here before you. Who he may be, whence he has come, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
pays him for his speeches, so profitable to the Germans, not one
of you knows. He has come here, befogged you, and will go on
his way to sow evil and treason. And you have believed him.
And we, who along with you have now carried our heavy cross
into the fourth year of the War&mdash;we are now to be regarded as
your enemies? Why? Is it because we never sent you into
action, but led you, bestrewing with officers&rsquo; corpses the whole of
the path covered by the regiment? Is it because that, of the
officers who led you in the beginning, there is not one left in the
regiment who is not maimed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He spoke with deep sincerity and pain in his voice. There were
moments when it seemed as if his words were breaking through
the withered crust of those hardened hearts, as if a break would
again take place in the attitude of the crowd.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He, your &lsquo;new friend,&rsquo; is calling you to mutiny, to violence,
to robbery. Do you understand who will benefit when, in Russia,
brother rises against brother, so as to turn to ashes, in sack and
fire, the last property left not only to the &lsquo;capitalists,&rsquo; but to the
poverty-stricken workers and peasants? No, it is not by violence,
but by law and right, that you will acquire land and liberty and
a tolerable existence. Your enemies are not here, among the
officers, but there&mdash;beyond the barbed wire. And we shall not
attain either to freedom or to peace by a dishonourable, cowardly
standing in one and the same place, but in the general mighty
rush of an <i>advance</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Was it that the impression of Sklianka&rsquo;s speech was still too
vivid or that the regiment took offence at the word &ldquo;cowardly&rdquo;&mdash;for
the most arrant coward will never forgive such a reminder&mdash;or,
finally, was it the fault of the magic word &ldquo;advance,&rdquo; which
for some time past had ceased to be tolerated in the Army? But
anyhow Albov was not allowed to continue his speech.</p>

<p>The crowd bellowed, belched forth curses, pressed forward
more and more, advancing toward the platform, and broke down
the railing. An ominous roar, faces distorted with fury, and
hands stretched forth towards the platform. The situation was
becoming critical. 2nd Lieut. Yassny pushed his way through to
Albov, took him by the arm, and forcibly led him to the exit.
The soldiers of the First Company had already rushed up to it
from all sides, and with their aid Albov, with great difficulty, made
his way out of the crowd, amidst a shower of choice abuse.
Someone shouted out after him:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait a bit, you &mdash;&mdash;; we will settle accounts with you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Night. The bivouac had grown quiet. Clouds had covered
the sky. It was dark. Albov, sitting on his bed in his narrow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
tent, illuminated by the stump of a candle, was writing a report
to the Commander of the Regiment:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The officers&mdash;powerless, insulted, meeting with distrust and
disobedience from their subordinates&mdash;can be of no further use.
I beg of you to apply for my reduction to the ranks, so that there
I might fulfil my duty honestly and to the end.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He lay down on his bed. He gripped his head in his hands.
A kind of uncanny, incomprehensible emptiness seized him, just
as if some unseen hand had drawn out of his head all thought,
out of his heart all pain. What was that? A noise was heard,
the tent-pole fell down, the light went out. A number of men on
the tent. Hard, cruel blows were showered on the whole of his
body. A sharp, intolerable pain shot through his head and his
chest. Then his whole face seemed covered with a warm, sticky
veil, and soon everything became still and calm again, as if all
that was terrible and hard to bear had torn itself away, had
remained here, on earth, while his soul was flying away somewhere
and was feeling light and joyous.</p>

<p>Albov awoke to feel something cold touching him: a private
of his company, Goulkin, an elderly man, was sitting at the foot
of his bed and wiping away the blood from his head with a wet
towel. He noticed that Albov had regained consciousness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look how they have mangled the man, the scum! It can
have been no other than the Fifth Company&mdash;I recognised one of
them. Does it hurt you much? Perhaps you would like me to
go for the doctor?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, my friend, it does not matter. Thank you!&rdquo; and
Albov pressed his hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And their Commander, too, Captain Bouravin, has met with
a misfortune. During the night they carried him past us on a
stretcher, wounded in the abdomen; the <i>sanitar</i> said that he would
not live. He was returning from reconnoitring, and the bullet
took just at our very barbed wire. Whether it was a German one
or whether our own people did not recognise him&mdash;who knows?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was silent for a while.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What has come to the people one simply can&rsquo;t understand.
And all this is just put on. It is not true&mdash;that which they say
against the officers&mdash;we understand that ourselves. Of course,
there are all sorts among you. But we know them very well.
Don&rsquo;t we see for ourselves that you, now, are for us with all
your heart. Or let us say 2nd Lieut. Yassny. Could such a one sell
himself? And yet, try to say a word, to take your part&mdash;there
would be no living for us. There is a great deal of hooliganism
now. It is only hooligans that men listen to. My idea is that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
all this is taking place because men have forgotten God. Men
have nothing to be afraid of.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Albov closed his eyes from weakness. Goulkin hastily
arranged the blanket, which had slipped to the floor, made the
sign of the cross over him, and quietly slipped out of the tent.</p>

<p>But sleep would not come. His heart was full of an inexhaustible
sadness and an oppressive feeling of loneliness. He yearned
so much to have some living being at hand, so that he might
silently, wordlessly feel its proximity, and not remain alone with
his dreadful thoughts. He regretted that he had not detained
Goulkin.</p>

<p>All was quiet. The whole camp was sleeping. Albov leaped
from his bed and lit the candle again. He was seized with a dull,
hopeless despair. He had no more faith in anything. Impenetrable
darkness lay before him. To make his exit from life? No,
that would be surrender. He must go on, with clenched teeth
and hardened heart, until some stray bullet&mdash;Russian or German&mdash;broke
the thread of his wearisome days.</p>

<p>Dawn was coming on. A new day was beginning, new Army
week-days, horribly like their predecessors.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Afterwards?</p>

<p>Afterwards the &ldquo;molten element&rdquo; overflowed its banks completely.
Officers were killed, burnt, drowned, torn asunder and
had their heads broken through with hammers, slowly, with
inexpressible cruelty.</p>

<p>Afterwards&mdash;millions of deserters. Like an avalanche the
soldiery moved along the railways, water-ways and country roads,
trampling down, breaking and destroying the last nerves of poor,
roadless Russia.</p>

<p>Afterwards&mdash;Tarnopol, Kalush, Kazan. Like a whirlwind
robbery, murder, violence, incendiarism swept over Galicia,
Volynia, the Podolsk and other provinces, leaving behind it
everywhere a trail of blood and arousing in the minds of the
Russian people, crazed with grief and weak in spirit, the monstrous
thought:</p>

<p>&ldquo;O Lord! if only the Germans would come quickly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was done by the soldier.</p>

<p>That soldier of whom a great Russian writer, with intuitive
conscience and a bold heart, has said:<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>&ldquo;... How many hast thou killed during these days, oh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
soldier? How many orphans hast thou made? How many
inconsolable mothers hast thou left? Dost thou hear the whisper
on their lips, from which thou hast driven the smile of joy for
evermore?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Murderer! Murderer!</p>

<p>&ldquo;But why speak of mothers, of orphaned children? A more
terrible moment came, which none had expected&mdash;and thou didst
betray Russia, thou didst cast the whole of the Motherland, which
had bred thee, under the feet of the foe!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thou, oh soldier, whom we loved so&mdash;and whom we still
love.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII.</a><br />
<span class="smcap">Officers&rsquo; Organisations.</span></h2>

<p>In the early days of April the idea arose among the Headquarters&rsquo;
officers of organising a &ldquo;Union of the Officers of
the Army and the Navy.&rdquo; The initiators of the Union<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> started
with the view that it was necessary &ldquo;to think alike, so as to
understand alike the events that were taking place, to work in the
same direction,&rdquo; for up to the present time &ldquo;the voice of the
officers&mdash;of all the officers&mdash;has been heard by none. As yet we
have said nothing about the great events amidst which we are
living. Everyone who chooses says for us whatever he chooses.
Military questions, and even the questions of our daily life and
internal order, are settled for us by anyone who likes and in any
way he likes.&rdquo; There were two objections made in principle, one
being the objection to the introduction by the officers themselves
into their ranks of those principles of collective self-government
with which the Army had been inoculated from outside, in the
form of Soviets, Committees and Congresses, and had brought
disintegration into it. The second objection was the fear lest the
appearance of an independent Officers&rsquo; Organisation should
deepen still more those differences which had arisen between the
soldiers and the officers. On the basis of these views we, along
with the Commander-in-Chief, at first took up an altogether
negative attitude towards this proposal. But life had already
broken out of its bounds and laughed at our motives. A draft
declaration was published, granting the Army full freedom for
forming Unions and meetings, and it would now have been an
injustice to the officers to deprive them of the right of professional
organisation, if only as a means of self-preservation. In practice,
officers&rsquo; societies had sprung up in many of the Armies, and in
Kiev, Moscow, Petrograd and other towns they had done so from
the earlier days of the Revolution. They all wandered in different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
directions, groping their way, while some Unions in the large
centres, under the influence of the disintegrating conditions of the
rear, displayed a strong leaning towards the policy of the Soviets.</p>

<p>The officers of the rear frequently lived a completely different
spiritual life from those of the Front. Thus, for instance, the
Moscow Soviet of officers&rsquo; delegates passed, in the beginning of
April, a resolution to the effect that &ldquo;the work of the Provisional
Government should proceed ... in the spirit of the
Socialistic and political demands of the Democracy, represented
by the Council of Workmen&rsquo;s and Soldiers&rsquo; Delegates,&rdquo; and
expressed a wish that there should be more representatives of the
Socialist parties in the Provisional Government. An adulteration
of the officers&rsquo; views was also developing on a larger scale; the
Petrograd officers&rsquo; Council summoned an &ldquo;All-Russia Congress
of officers&rsquo; delegates, Army surgeons and officers&rdquo; in Petrograd
for May 8th. This circumstance was the more undesirable in that
the initiator of the Congress&mdash;the Executive Committee, with
Lieutenant-Colonel Goushchin, of the General Staff, at its head&mdash;had
already disclosed to the full its negative policy by its participation
in the drafting of the declaration of soldiers&rsquo; rights, by its
active co-operation in the Polivanov Commission and its servility
before the Council of Workmen&rsquo;s and Soldier&rsquo;s Delegates, and by
its endeavours to unite with it. A proposal in this sense being
made, the Council, however, replied that such a union was &ldquo;as
yet impossible on technical grounds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Having discounted all these circumstances, the Supreme
Commander-in-Chief gave his approval to the summoning of a
Congress of officers, on condition that no pressure should be
exercised either in his name or in that of the Chief-of-Staff. This
scrupulous attitude somewhat complicated matters. Some of the
Staffs, being out of sympathy with the idea, prevented the circulation
of the appeal, while some of the High Commanders, as, for
example, the Commander of the troops of the Omsk district, forbade
the delegation of officers altogether. In some places also
this question roused the suspicion of the soldiers and caused some
complications, in consequence of which the initiators of the
Congress invited the units to delegate soldiers as well as officers
to be present at the sessions.</p>

<p>Despite all obstacles, over 300 officer delegates gathered in
Moghilev, 76 per cent. being from the Front, 17 per cent. from
fighting units in the rear, and 7 per cent. from the rear. On
May 7th the Congress was opened with a speech by the Supreme
Commander-in-Chief. On that day, for the first time, the High
Command said, not in a secret meeting, not in a confidential<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
letter, but openly, before the whole country: &ldquo;Russia is perishing.&rdquo;
General Alexeiev said: &ldquo;In appeals, in general orders, in
the columns of the Daily Press, we often meet with the short
sentence: &lsquo;Our country is in danger.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have grown too well accustomed to this phrase. We
feel as if we were reading an old chronicle of bygone days, and
do not ponder over the grim meaning of this curt sentence. But,
gentlemen, this is, I regret to say, a serious fact. <i>Russia is
perishing. She stands on the brink of an abyss. A few more
shocks, and she will crash with all her weight into it.</i> The enemy
has occupied one-eighth part of her territory. He cannot be
bribed by the Utopian phrase: &lsquo;Peace without annexations or
indemnities.&rsquo; He says frankly that he will not leave our soil. He
is stretching forth his greedy grip to lands where no enemy soldier
has ever set foot&mdash;to the rich lands of Volynia, Podolia and Kiev&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>,
to the whole right bank of our Dnieper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what are we going to do? Will the Russian Army allow
this to happen? Will we not thrust this insolent foe out of our
country and let the diplomatists conclude peace afterwards, with
annexations or without them?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us be frank. The fighting spirit of the Russian Army has
fallen; but yesterday strong and terrible, it now stands in fatal
impotence before the foe. Its former traditional loyalty to the
Motherland has been replaced by a yearning for peace and rest.
Instead of fortitude, the baser instincts and a thirst for
self-preservation are rampant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At home, where is that strong authority for which the whole
country is craving? Where is that powerful authority which
would force every citizen to do his duty honestly by the
Motherland?</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are told that it will soon appear, but as yet it does not
exist.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is the love of country, where is patriotism?</p>

<p>&ldquo;The great word &lsquo;brotherhood&rsquo; has been inscribed on our
banners, but it has not been inscribed in our hearts and minds.
Class enmity rages amongst us. Whole classes which have
honestly fulfilled their duty to their country have fallen under
suspicion, and on this foundation a deep gulf has been created
between two parts of the Army&mdash;the officers and the soldiers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And it is at this very moment that the first Congress of
officers of the Russian Army has been summoned. I am of the
opinion that a more convenient, a more timely moment, could not
have been chosen to attain unity in our family, to form a general
united family of the corps of Russian officers, to discuss the means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
of breathing ardour into our hearts, <i>for without ardour there is no
victory, without victory there is no salvation, no Russia</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May your work therefore be inspired with love for your
Motherland and with heartfelt regard for the soldier; mark the
ways for raising the moral and intellectual calibre of the soldiers,
so that they may become your sincere and hearty comrades. Do
away with that estrangement which has been artificially sown in
our family.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At the present moment&mdash;this is a disease common to all&mdash;people
would like to set all the citizens of Russia on platforms or
pedestals and scrutinise how many stand behind each of them.
What does it matter that the masses of the Army accepted the
new order and the new Constitution sincerely, honestly and with
enthusiasm?</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>We must all unite on one great object: Russia is in danger.
As members of the great Army, we must save her. Let
this object unite us and give us strength to work.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>This speech, in which the leader of the Army expressed &ldquo;the
anxiety of his heart,&rdquo; served as the prologue to his retirement.
The Revolutionary Democracy had already passed its sentence
on General Alexeiev at its memorable session with the Commanders-in-Chief
on May 4th; now, after May 7th, a bitter campaign
was begun against him in the Radical Press, in which the Soviet
semi-official organ <i>Isvestia</i> competed with Lenin&rsquo;s papers in the
triviality and impropriety of its remarks. This campaign was the
more significant in that the Minister of War, Kerensky, was
clearly on the side of the Soviet in this matter.</p>

<p>As if to supplement the words of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief,
I said in my speech, when touching on the internal
situation in the country:</p>

<p>&ldquo;... Under pressure of the unavoidable laws of history,
autocracy has fallen, and our country has passed under the rule
of the people. We stand on the threshold of a new life, long and
passionately awaited, for which many thousand Idealists have
gone to the block, languished in the mines and pined in the
<i>tundras</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But we look to the future with anxiety and perplexity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For there is no liberty in the Revolutionary torture-chamber.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no righteousness in misrepresenting the voice of
the people.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no equality in the hounding down of classes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And there is no strength in that insane rout where all around
seek to grasp all that they possibly can, at the expense of their
suffering country, where thousands of greedy hands are stretched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
out towards power, breaking down the foundations of that
country....&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the sessions of the Congress began. Whoever was
present has carried away, probably for the rest of his life, an
indelible impression produced by the story of the sufferings of the
officers. It could never be written, as it was told with chilling
restraint by these, Captain Bouravin and Lieutenant Albov, who
touched upon their most intimate and painful experiences. They
had suffered till they could suffer no more; in their hearts there
were neither tears nor complaints.</p>

<p>I looked at the boxes, where the &ldquo;younger comrades&rdquo; sat
who had been sent to watch for &ldquo;counter-Revolution.&rdquo; I
wanted to read in their faces the impression produced by all that
they had heard. And it seemed to me that I saw the blush of
shame. Probably it only seemed so to me, for they soon made a
stormy protest, demanded the right of voting at the Congress,
and&mdash;five roubles per day &ldquo;officer&rsquo;s allowance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At thirteen general meetings the Congress passed a series of
resolutions.</p>

<p>Among all the classes, castes, professions and trades which
exhibited a general elemental desire to get from the weak Government
all that was possible, in their own private interests, the
officers were the only Corporation which never asked anything
<i>for itself personally</i>.</p>

<p>The officers requested and demanded <i>authority</i>&mdash;over themselves
and over the Army. A firm, single, national authority&mdash;&ldquo;commanding,
not appealing.&rdquo; The authority of a Government
leaning on the trust of the nation, not on irresponsible organisations.
Such an authority the officers were prepared wholeheartedly
and unreservedly to obey, <i>quite irrespective of differences
of political opinions</i>. I affirm, moreover, that all the inner
social class conflict which was blazing up more and more
throughout the country did not affect the officers at the Front,
who were immersed in their work and in their sorrows; it did not
touch them deeply; the conflict attracted the attention of the
officers only when its results obviously endangered the very existence
of the country, and of the Army in particular. Of course,
I am speaking of the mass of the officers; individual leanings
towards reaction undoubtedly existed, but they were in no respect
characteristic of the Officers&rsquo; Corps in 1917.</p>

<p>One of the finest representatives of the Officers&rsquo; Class, General
Markov, a thoroughly educated man, wrote to Kerensky, condemning
his system of slighting the Command: &ldquo;Being a soldier
by nature, birth and education, I can judge and speak only of my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
own military profession. All other reforms and alterations in
the constitution of our country interest me only as an ordinary
citizen. But I know the Army; I have devoted to it the best days
of my life; I have paid for its successes with the blood of those
who were near to me, and have myself come out of action steeped
in blood.&rdquo; This the Revolutionary Democracy had not understood
or taken into consideration.</p>

<p>The Officers&rsquo; Congress in Petrograd, at which about 700 delegates
were gathered (May 18-26), passed off in a totally different
manner. It split into two sharply-divided camps: the Officers and
officials of the Rear who had given themselves to politics and a
smaller number of real officers of the Line who had become delegates
through a misunderstanding of the matter. The Executive
Committee drew up their programme in strict agreement with the
custom of the Soviet Congresses: (1) The attitude of the Congress
towards the Provisional Government and the Soviet; (2) the War;
(3) the Constituent Assembly; (4) the labour question; (5) the land
question; and (6) the reorganisation of the Army on Democratic
principles. An exaggerated importance was attached to the Congress
in Petrograd, and at its opening pompous speeches were
made by many members of the Government and by foreign representatives;
the Congress was even greeted in the name of the
Soviet by Nahamkes. The very first day revealed the irreconcilable
differences between the two groups. These differences
were inevitable, if only because, even on such a cardinal question
as &ldquo;Order No. 1.,&rdquo; the Vice-Chairman of the Congress, Captain
Brzozek, expressed the view that &ldquo;its issue was dictated by historical
necessity: the soldier was downtrodden, and it was imperatively
necessary to free him.&rdquo; This declaration was greeted with
prolonged applause by part of the delegates!</p>

<p>After a series of stormy meetings, a resolution was passed by
a majority of 265 against 246, which stated that &ldquo;the Revolutionary
power of the country was in the hands of the organised
peasants, workmen and soldiers, who form the predominating
mass of the population,&rdquo; and that therefore the Government must
be responsible to the All-Russia Soviet!</p>

<p>Even the resolution advocating an advance was passed by a
majority of little more than two-thirds of those who cast their
votes.</p>

<p>The attitude of the Petrograd Congress is to be explained by
the declaration made on May 26th by that group, which, reflecting
the real opinion of the Front, took the point of view of &ldquo;all
possible support to the Provisional Government.&rdquo; &ldquo;In summoning
the Congress the Executive Committee of the Petrograd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
Council of Officers&rsquo; Delegates did not seek for the solution of the
most essential problem of the moment&mdash;the regeneration of the
Army&mdash;since the question of the fighting capacity of the Army
and of the measures for raising its level was not even mentioned
in the programme, and was included only at our request. If we
are to believe the statement&mdash;strange, to say no more&mdash;made by
the Chairman, Lieutenant-Colonel Goushchin, the object of the
summoning of the Congress was the desire of the Executive
Committee to pass under our flag into the Council of Workmen&rsquo;s
and Soldiers&rsquo; Delegates.&rdquo; This declaration led to a series of
serious incidents; three-quarters of the delegates left the meeting
and the Congress came to an end.</p>

<p>I have mentioned the question of the Petrograd Officers&rsquo;
Council and Congress only in order to show the spirit of a certain
section of the officers of the Rear, which was in frequent contact
with the official and unofficial rulers, and represented, in the eyes
of the latter, the &ldquo;voice of the Army.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Moghilev Congress, which attracted the unflagging attention
of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief, and was much favoured
by him, closed on May 22nd. At this time General Alexeiev had
already been relieved of the command of the Russian Army. So
deeply had this episode affected him that he was unable to attend
the last meeting. I bade farewell to the Congress in the
following words:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Supreme Commander-in-Chief, who is leaving his post,
has commissioned me, gentlemen, to convey to you his sincere
greetings, and to say that his heart, that of an old soldier, beats
in unison with yours, that it aches with the same pain, and lives
with the same hope for the regeneration of the disrupted, but
ever great, Russian Army.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me add a few words from myself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have gathered here from the distant blood-bespattered
marches of our land, and laid before us your quenchless sorrow
and your soul-felt grief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have unrolled before us a vivid and painful picture of
the life and work of the officers amidst the raging sea of the
Army.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You, who have stood a countless number of times in the face
of death! You, who have intrepidly led your men against the
dense rows of the enemy&rsquo;s barbed wire, to the rare boom of your
own guns, treacherously deprived of ammunition! You, who,
hardening your hearts, but keeping up your spirits, have cast the
last handful of earth into the grave of your fallen son, brother,
or friend!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you quail now?</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!</p>

<p>&ldquo;You who are weak, raise your heads. You who are strong,
give of your determination, of your aspirations, of your desire to
work for the happiness of your Motherland&mdash;pour them into the
thinned ranks of your comrades at the Front. You are not alone.
With you are all those who are honourable, all who think, all who
have paused at the brink of that common sense which is now being
abolished.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The soldiers also will go with you, understanding clearly
that you are leading them, not backwards, to serfdom and to
spiritual poverty, but forwards, to freedom and to light.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And then such a thunderstorm will break over the foe as will
put an end both to him and to the War.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These three years of the War I have lived one life with you,
thought the same thoughts, shared with you the joy of victory
and the burning pain of retreat. I have therefore the right to
fling into the faces of those who have outraged our hearts, who
from the very first days of the Revolution have wrought the work
of Cain on the corps of officers&mdash;I have the right to fling in their
faces the words: &lsquo;You lie! The Russian officer has never been
either a mercenary or a Pretorian.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Under the old rÃ©gime you were victimised, down-trodden,
and deprived of all that makes life worth living. In no less a
degree than yourselves, leading a life of semi-beggary, our
officers of the Line have managed to carry through their wretched,
laborious life like a burning torch, the thirst for achievement for
the happiness of his Motherland.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then let my call be heard through these walls by the
builders of the new life of the State:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take care of the officer! For from the beginning and till
now he has stood, faithfully and without relief, on guard over
the order of the Russian State. He can be relieved by death
alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Printed by the Committee, the text of my speech was circulated
at the Front, and I was happy to learn, from many letters and
telegrams, that the words spoken in defence of the officer had
touched his aching heart.</p>

<p>The Congress left a permanent institution at the Stavka&mdash;the
&ldquo;Chief Committee of the Officers&rsquo; Union.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> During the first
three months of its existence the Committee did not succeed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
rooting itself deeply in the Army. Its activities were confined to
organising branches of the Union in the Armies and in military
circles, to the examination of the complaints that reached it. In
exceptional cases incompetent officers were recommended for
dismissal (the &ldquo;black-board&rdquo;); to a certain very limited degree
officers expelled by the soldiers were granted assistance, and
declarations were addressed to the Government and to the Press
in connection with the more important events in public and military
life. After the June advance the tone of these declarations became
acrimonious, critical, and defiant, which seriously disturbed the
Prime Minister, who persistently sought to have the Chief Committee
transferred from Moghilev to Moscow, as he considered
that its attitude was a danger to the Stavka.</p>

<p>The Committee, which was somewhat passive during the
command of General Brussilov, did, indeed, take part afterwards
in General Kornilov&rsquo;s venture. But it was not this circumstance
that caused the change in its attitude. <i>The Committee undoubtedly
reflected the general spirit with which the Command and the
Russian officers were then imbued, a spirit which had become
hostile to the Provisional Government.</i> Also, no clear idea had
been formed among the officers of the political groups within the
Government of the covert struggle proceeding between them, or
of the protective part played by many representatives of the
Liberal Democracy among them. A hostile attitude was thus
created towards the Government as a whole.</p>

<p>Having remained hitherto perfectly loyal and in the majority
of cases well-disposed, having patiently borne, much against the
grain, the experiments which the Provisional Government made,
deliberately or involuntarily, on the country and on the Army,
these elements lived only in the hope of the regeneration of the
Army, of an advance and of victory. When all these hopes
crashed to the ground, then, not being united in their ideals with
the second Coalitional Government, but, on the contrary, deeply
distrusting it, the masses of the officers abandoned the Provisional
Government, which thus lost its last reliable support.</p>

<p>This moment is of great historical importance, giving the key
to the understanding of many later events. As a whole, deeply
democratic in their personnel, views and conditions of life, <i>rejected
by the Revolutionary Democracy</i> with incredible harshness and
cynicism, and finding no real support in the liberal circles in close
touch with the Government, the Russian officers found themselves
in a state of tragic isolation. This isolation and bewilderment
served more than once afterwards as a fertile soil for outside
influences, foreign to the traditions of the officer caste and to its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
former political character&mdash;influences which led to dissension, and
in the end to fratricide. For there can be no doubt that all the
power, all the organisation, both of the Red and of the White
Armies, rested exclusively on the personality of the former
Russian officer.</p>

<p>And if afterwards, in the course of three years of conflict, we
have witnessed the rise of two conflicting forces in the Russian
public life of the anti-Bolshevist camp, we must seek for their
original source not in political differences only, but also in that
work of Cain towards the officers&rsquo; caste, which was wrought by
the Revolutionary Democracy from the first days of the
Revolution.</p>

<p>As everyone realised that the &ldquo;new order&rdquo; and the Front itself
are on the verge of collapse, it was obvious that officers should
have attempted some organisation to meet such a contingency.
But the advocates of action were lying in prison; the Chief Council
of the Officers&rsquo; Union, which was best suited for this task, had
been broken up by Kerensky in the latter days of August. The
majority of the responsible leaders of the Army were perturbed
by a terrible and not unfounded fear for the fate of the Russian
officers. In this respect the correspondence between General
Kornilov and General Doukhonin is very characteristic. After the
Bolshevist <i>coup d&rsquo;Ã©tat</i> on November 1 (14), 1917, General
Kornilov wrote to Doukhonin from his prison in Bykhov:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Foreseeing the further course of events, I think that it is
necessary for you to take such measures as would create a favourable
atmosphere, while thoroughly safeguarding Headquarters,
for a struggle against the coming Anarchy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Among these measures General Kornilov suggested &ldquo;the
concentration in Moghilev, or in a point near to it, under a reliable
guard, of a store of rifles, cartridges, machine-guns, automatic
guns and hand-grenades for distribution among the officer-volunteers,
who will undoubtedly gather together in this region.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Doukhonin made a note against this point: &ldquo;This might lead
to excesses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus the constant morbid fears of an officers&rsquo; &ldquo;Counter-Revolution&rdquo;
proved to be in vain. Events took the officers
unawares. They were unorganised, bewildered; they did not think
of their own safety, and finally scattered their forces.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV.</a><br />
<span class="smcap">The Revolution and the Cossacks.</span></h2>

<p>A peculiar part was played by the Cossacks in the history
of the Revolution.</p>

<p>Built up historically, in the course of several centuries, the
relations of the Cossacks with the Central Government, common
to Russia, were of a dual character. The Government did all to
encourage the development of Cossack colonisation on the Russian
south-eastern borders, where war was unceasing. It made
allowances for the peculiarities of the warlike, agricultural life
of the Cossacks, and allowed them a certain degree of
independence and individual forms of democratic rule, with
representative organs (the Kosh, kroog, rada), an elected &ldquo;Army
elder&rdquo; and hetmans.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In its weakness,&rdquo; says Solovyov, &ldquo;The State did not look
too strictly on the activities of the Cossacks, so long as they
were directed only against foreign lands; the State being weak, it
was considered needful to give these restless forces an outlet.&rdquo;
But the &ldquo;activities&rdquo; of the Cossacks were more than once directed
against Moscow as well. This circumstance led to a prolonged
internecine struggle, which lasted until the end of the eighteenth
century, when, after a ferocious suppression of the Pougatchov
Rebellion, the free Cossacks of the South-East were dealt a final
blow; they gradually lost their markedly oppositionary character,
and even gained the reputation of the most conservative element
in the State, the pillars of the throne and the rÃ©gime.</p>

<p>From that time onward the Government incessantly showed
favour to the Cossacks by emphasising their really great merits,
by solemn promises to preserve their &ldquo;Cossack Liberties,&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
by the appointment of members of the Imperial family to honorary
posts among the Cossacks. At the same time, the Government
took all measures to prevent these &ldquo;liberties&rdquo; from developing
to excess at the expense of that ruthless centralisation, which was
a historical necessity in the beginning of the building up of the
Russian State and a vast historical blunder in its later development.
To the number of these measures we must refer the limitation
of Cossack self-government, and, latterly, the traditional
appointment to the post of Hetman of persons not belonging to
the Cossack caste, and often complete strangers to the life of the
Cossacks. The oldest and most numerous Cossack Army, that of
the Don, has had Generals of German origin at its head more than
once.</p>

<p>It seemed as if the Czarist Government had every reason to
depend upon the Cossacks. The repeated repression of the local
political labour and agrarian disturbances which broke out in
Russia, the crushing of a more serious rising&mdash;the revolution of
1905-1906, in which a great part was played by the Cossack troops&mdash;all
this seemed to confirm the established opinion of the
Cossacks. On the other hand, sundry episodes of the &ldquo;repressions,&rdquo;
accompanied by inevitable violence, sometimes cruelty,
were widely spread among the people, were exaggerated, and
created a hostile attitude towards the Cossacks at the factories,
in the villages, among the Liberal <i>intelligencia</i>, and especially
among those elements which are known as the Revolutionary
Democracy. Throughout the whole of the underground literature&mdash;in
its appeals, leaflets, and pictures&mdash;the idea of a &ldquo;Cossack&rdquo;
became synonymous with &ldquo;servant&rdquo; of the Reactionary party.</p>

<p>This definition was greatly exaggerated. The bard of the
Don Cossacks, Mitrophan Bogayevsky, says of the political
character of the Cossacks: &ldquo;The first and fundamental condition
which prevented the Cossacks, at least in the beginning, from
breaking up was the idea of the State, a lawful order, a deep-seated
realisation of the necessity of a life within the bounds of
law. This seeking of a lawful order runs, and has run, like a
scarlet thread through all the circles of all the Cossack Armies.&rdquo;
But such altruistic motives, by themselves, do not exhaust the
question. Notwithstanding the grievous weight of universal
military service, the Cossacks, especially those of the South,
enjoyed a certain prosperity which excluded that important
stimulus which roused against the Government and the rÃ©gime
both the workers&rsquo; class and the peasantry of Central Russia. An
extraordinarily complicated agrarian question set the caste
economic interests of the Cossacks against the interests of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
&ldquo;outsider&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> settlers. Thus, for instance, in the oldest and
largest Cossack Army, that of the Don, the amount of land secured
to an individual farm was, on the average, in <i>dessiateens</i>: for
Cossacks, 19.3 to 30; for native peasants, 6.5; for immigrant
peasants, 1.3. Finally, owing to historical conditions and a
narrow territorial system of recruiting, the Cossack units
possessed a perfectly homogeneous personnel, a great internal
unity, and a discipline which was firm, though somewhat peculiar
as to the mutual relations between the officers and the privates,
and therefore they conceded complete obedience to their chiefs
and to the Supreme Power.</p>

<p>With the support of all these motives, the Government made
a wide use of Cossack troops for suppressing popular agitation,
and thus roused against them the mute exasperation of the fermenting,
discontented masses of the population.</p>

<p>In return for their historical &ldquo;liberties,&rdquo; the Cossack Armies,
as I have said, give all but universal military service. Its burden
and the degree of relative importance of these troops among the
armed forces of the Russian Empire are shown in the following

<p>Partly as cavalry of the line&mdash;in divisions and corps, partly as
Army corps and divisional cavalry&mdash;in regiments, sub-divisions
and detached <i>sotnias</i>, the Cossack units were scattered over all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
Russian fronts, from the Baltic to Persia. <i>Among the Cossacks,
as against all the other component parts of the Army, desertion
was unknown.</i></p>

<p>At the outbreak of Revolution all the political groups, and
even the representatives of the Allies, devoted great attention to
the Cossacks&mdash;some building exaggerated hopes on them, others
regarding them with unconcealed suspicion. The circles of the
Right looked to the Cossacks for Restoration; the Liberal Bourgeoisie,
for active support of law and order; while the parties of
the Left feared that they were counter-Revolutionary, and therefore
started a strong propaganda in the Cossack units, seeking
to disintegrate them. This was to some extent assisted by the
spirit of repentance which showed itself at all Cossack meetings,
Congresses, &ldquo;Circles&rdquo; and &ldquo;Radas&rdquo; at which the late power
was accused of systematically rousing the Cossacks against the
people. The mutual relations between the Cossacks and the
local agricultural population were unusually complicated,
especially in the Cossack territories of European Russia.<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> Intermingled
with the Cossack allotments were peasant lands&mdash;those
of whilom settlers (the indigenous peasantry)&mdash;lands let on long
lease, on which large settlements had sprung up, finally lands
which had been granted by the Emperor to various persons and
which had gradually passed into the hands of &ldquo;outsiders.&rdquo; On
the basis of these mutual relations dissension now arose which
began to assume the character of violence and forcible seizures.
With respect to the Don Army, which gave the keynote to all
others, the Provisional Government considered it necessary to
publish on April 7th an appeal in which, while affirming that &ldquo;the
rights of the Cossacks to the land, as they have grown historically,
remain inviolable,&rdquo; also promised the &ldquo;outsider&rdquo; population,
&ldquo;whose claim to the land is also based on historical rights,&rdquo; that
it would be satisfied, in as great a measure as possible, by the
Constituent Assembly. This agrarian puzzle, which surrounded
with uncertainty the most tender point of the Cossacks&rsquo; hopes,
was explained unequivocally, in the middle of May, by the
Minister of Agriculture, Tchernov (at the All-Russia Peasant
Congress), who stated that the Cossacks held large tracts of land
and that now they would have to surrender a portion of their
lands.</p>

<p>In the Cossack territories meanwhile work was in full swing
in the sphere of self-determination and self-government; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
information supplied by the Press was vague and contradictory;
no one had yet heard the voice of the Cossacks as a whole. One
can understand, therefore, that general attention which was concentrated
on the All-Russia Cossack Congress, which gathered
in Petrograd in the beginning of June.</p>

<p>The Cossacks paid a tribute to the Revolution and to the State,
referred to their own needs (after all, the question of their holdings
was the most vital one), and ... smiled to the
Soviet....</p>

<p>The impression thus produced was indefinite; neither were the
hopes of the one side fulfilled nor the fears of the other dissipated.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, at the initiative of the Revolutionary Democracy,
a violent propaganda was set on foot for introducing the idea of
doing away with the Cossacks as a separate caste. But, on the
whole, this idea of self-abolition had no success. On the contrary,
a growing aspiration spread among the Cossacks for maintaining
their internal organisation and for the union of all the
Cossack Armies.</p>

<p>Cossack Governments sprang up everywhere, elected Hetmans
and representative institutions (&ldquo;Circles&rdquo; and Radas), whose
authority increased in accordance with the weakening of the
authority and power of the Provisional Government. Such
eminent men appeared at the head of the Cossacks as Kaledin
(the Don), Doutov (Orenburg), and Karaoulov (the Terek).</p>

<p>A triple power was formed in the Cossack territories; the
Hetman with his Government, the commissary of the Provisional
Government, and the Soviet.<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>The Commissaries, however, after a short and unsuccessful
struggle, soon subsided and exhibited no activity. Far more
serious became the struggle of the Cossack authority with the
local Soviets and Committees, which sought support in the unruly
mob of soldiers who flooded the territories under the name of
Reserve Army Battalions and Rear Army Units. This curse of
the population positively terrorised the land, creating anarchy
in the towns and settlements, instituting sacks, seizing lands and
businesses, trampling upon all rights, all authority, and creating
intolerable conditions of life. The Cossacks had nothing with
which to combat this violence&mdash;all their units were at the Front.
Only in the Don territory, accidentally, in the autumn of 1917,
not without the deliberate connivance of the Stavka, a division
was concentrated, and afterwards three divisions, with the aid of
which General Kaledin attempted to restore order.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span></p>

<p>But all the measures taken by him, as for instance the
occupation by armed forces of railway junctions, of the more
important mines, and of large centres, which secured normal
communication and supplies for the centre and the fronts, were
met not only with violent resistance on the part of the Soviets
and with accusations of counter-revolutionism, but even with
some suspicion on the part of the Provisional Government. At
the same time the Cossacks of the Kouban and of the Terek asked
the Don to send them if only a few <i>sotnias</i>, as it was &ldquo;becoming
impossible to breathe for <i>comrades</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The friendly relations, instituted in the early days of the
Revolution, between the general Russian and the Cossack Revolutionary
Democracies were soon broken off finally. &ldquo;Cossack
Socialism&rdquo; turned out to be so self-sufficing, so concentrated in
its own castes and corporation limits, that it could find no place in
that doctrine.</p>

<p>The Soviets insisted on the equalising of the holdings of the
Cossacks and the peasants, while the Cossacks vigorously defended
their right of property and disposal in the Cossack lands, basing
it on their historical merits as conquerors, protectors, and
colonisers of the former marches of Russia&rsquo;s territory.</p>

<p>The organisation of a general territorial Government failed.
An internecine struggle began.</p>

<p>The consequences were two-fold: The first was a painful
atmosphere of estrangement and hostility between the Cossacks
and the &ldquo;outsider&rdquo; population, which later, in the swiftly
changing kaleidoscope of the civil war, sometimes assumed
monstrous forms of mutual extermination, as the power passed
from the hands of one side into those of the other. Along with
this, one or the other half of the population of the larger Cossack
territories were generally deemed as participating in the building
up and the economy of the land.<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> The second was the so-called
Cossack separatism or self-determination.</p>

<p>The Cossacks had no reason to expect from the Revolutionary
Democracy a favourable settlement of their destiny, especially in
the question most vital to it&mdash;the land question. On the other
hand, the Provisional Government had also assumed an
ambiguous attitude in this matter, and the Government power
was openly tending to its fall. The future assumed altogether
indefinite outlines. Hence, independently of the general healthy
aspiration towards decentralisation, there appeared among the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
Cossacks, who for centuries had been seeking &ldquo;freedom,&rdquo; a
tendency themselves to secure the maximum of independence, so
as to place the future Constituent Assembly before an accomplished
fact, or as the more outspoken Cossack leaders put it, &ldquo;that there
should be something from which to knock off.&rdquo; Hence a gradual
evolution from territorial self-government to autonomy, federation,
and confederation. Hence, finally&mdash;with the intrusion of
individual local self-love, ambition, and interests&mdash;a permanent
struggle began with every principle of an imperial tendency, a
struggle which weakened both sides and greatly prolonged the
civil war.<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> It was these circumstances, too, that gave birth to the
idea of an independent Cossack army, which first arose among the
Cossacks of the Kouban and was not then supported by Kaledin
and the more imperialistic elements of the Don.</p>

<p>All that I have related refers mainly to the three Cossack bodies
(the Don, the Kouban, and the Terek) which form more than
sixty per cent. of Cossack-dom. But the general characteristic
features belong to the other Cossack armies as well.</p>

<p>Along with the alterations in the composition of the Provisional
Government and with the decline of its authority, changes took
place in the attitude toward it of Cossack-dom, expressing themselves
in the resolutions and appeals of the Council of the union
of the Cossack armies, of the hetmans, circles, and Governments.
If before July the Cossacks voted for all possible support to the
Government and for complete obedience, later, however, <i>while
acknowledging the authority of the Government to the very end</i>,
it comes forward in sharp opposition to it on the questions of the
organisation of the Cossack administration and <i>zemstvo</i>, of the
employment of Cossacks for the repression of rebellious troops and
districts and so forth. In October the Kouban rada assumes
constituent powers and publishes the constitution of the &ldquo;Kouban
territory.&rdquo; It speaks of the Government in such a manner as the
following: &ldquo;When will the Provisional Government shake off
these fumes (the Bolshevist aggression) and put an end, by resolute
measures, to these scandals?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Provisional Government, being already without authority
and without any real power, surrendered all its positions and
agreed to peace with the Cossack Governments.</p>

<p>It is remarkable that, even at the end of October, when, owing
to the breach of communications, no correct information had yet
been received on the Don about the events in Petrograd and
Moscow and about the fate of the Provisional Government, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
when it was supposed that its fragments were functioning
somewhere or other, the Cossack elders, in the person of the
representatives of the South-Eastern Union, then gathering,<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
sought to get into touch with the Government, offering it aid
against the Bolsheviks, but conditioning this aid with a whole series
of economic demands: a non-interest-bearing loan of 500,000,000
roubles, the State to pay all the expenses of supporting Cossack
units outside the territory of the union, the institution of a
pension fund for all sufferers, and the right of the Cossacks to all
&ldquo;spoils of war&rdquo;(?) which might be taken in the course of the
coming civil war.</p>

<p>It is not without interest that for a long time Pourishkevitch
cherished the idea of the transfer of the State Duma to the Don,
as a counterpoise to the Provisional Government and for the
preservation of the source of authority, in case of the fall of
the latter. Kaledin&rsquo;s attitude towards this proposal was negative.</p>

<p>A characteristic indication of the attitude which the Cossacks
had succeeded in retaining towards themselves in the most varied
circles was that attraction to the Don which later, in the winter of
1917, led thitherward Rodzianko, Miliukov, General Alexeiev, the
Bykhov prisoners, Savinkov, and even Kerensky, who came to
General Kaledin, in Novotcherkassk, in the latter days of
November, but was not received by him. Pourishkevitch alone
did not come, and that only because he was then in prison in
Petrograd, in the hands of the Bolsheviks.</p>

<p>And suddenly it turned out that the whole thing was a
mystification, pure and simple, that at that time the Cossacks had
no power left whatever.</p>

<p>In view of the growing disorders on the Cossack territory,
the hetmans repeatedly appealed for the recall from the front of
if only part of the Cossack divisions. They were awaited with
enormous impatience, and the most radiant hopes were built on
them. In October these hopes seemed to be on the eve of
fulfilment; the Cossack divisions had started for home. Overcoming
all manner of obstacles on their way, retarded at every
step by the Vikzhel (All-Russia Executive Railway Committee)
and the local Soviets, subjected more than once to insults,
disarmament, resorting in one place to requests, in another to
cunning, and in some places to armed threats, the Cossack units
forced their way into their territories.</p>

<p>But no measures could preserve the Cossack units from the fate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
which had befallen the Army, for the whole of the psychological
atmosphere and all the factors of disruption, internal and external,
were absorbed by the Cossack masses, perhaps less intensively,
but on the whole in the same way. The two unsuccessful and,
for the Cossacks, incomprehensible marches on Petrograd, with
Krymov<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> and Krasnov,<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> introduced still greater confusion into
their vague political outlook.</p>

<p>The return of the Cossack troops to their homeland brought
complete disenchantment with it: they&mdash;at least the Cossacks of
the Don, the Kouban, and the Terek<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>&mdash;brought with them from
the front the most genuine Bolshevism, void, of course, of any kind
of ideology, but with all the phenomena of complete disintegration
which we know so well. This disintegration ripened gradually,
showed itself later, but at once exhibiting itself in the denial of
the authority of the &ldquo;elders,&rdquo; the negation of all power, by
mutiny, violence, the persecution and surrender of the officers,
but principally by complete abandonment of any struggle against
the Soviet power, which falsely promised the inviolability of the
Cossack rights and organisation. Bolshevism and the Cossack
organisation! Such grotesque contradictions were brought to
the surface daily by the reality of Russian life, on the basis of that
drunken debauch into which its long-desired freedom had
degenerated.</p>

<p>Now began the tragedy of Cossack life and the Cossack family
in which an insurmountable barrier had arisen between the
&ldquo;elders&rdquo; and the &ldquo;men of the front,&rdquo; destroying their life and
rousing the children against their fathers.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV.</a><br />
<span class="smcap">National Units.</span></h2>

<p>In the old Russian Army the national question scarcely existed.
Among the soldiery the representatives of the races inhabiting
Russia experienced somewhat greater hardships in the service,
caused by their ignorance or imperfect knowledge of the Russian
language, in which their training was carried on. It was only
this ground&mdash;the technical difficulties of training&mdash;and perhaps
that of general roughness and barbarism, but in no case that of
racial intolerance, that often led to that friction, which made the
position of the alien elements difficult, the more so that, according
to the system of mixed drafting, they were generally torn from
their native lands; the territorial system of filling the ranks of the
Army was considered to be technically irrational and politically&mdash;not
void of danger. The Little Russian question in particular
did not exist <i>at all</i>. The Little Russian speech (outside the limits
of official training), songs and music received full recognition
and did not rouse in anyone any feeling of separateness, being
accepted as Russian, as one&rsquo;s own. In the Army, with the exception
of the Jews, all the other alien elements were absorbed fairly
quickly and permanently; the community of the Army was in no
way a conductor either for compulsory Russification or for
national Chauvinism.</p>

<p>Still less were national differences to be noticed in the
community of officers. Qualities and virtues&mdash;corporative,
military, pertaining to comradeship or simply human, overshadowed
or totally obliterated racial barriers. Personally, during
my twenty-five years of service before the revolution, it never
came into my head to introduce this element into my relations as
commander, as colleague, or as comrade. And this was done
intuitively, not as the result of certain views and convictions. The
national questions which <i>were raised outside the Army</i>, in the
political life of the country, interested me, agitated me, were
settled by me in one or the other direction, harshly and irrecon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>cilably
at times, but always without trespassing on the boundaries
of military life.</p>

<p>The Jews occupied a somewhat different position. I shall
return to this question later. But it may be said that, with respect
to the old Army, this question was of popular rather than of
political significance. It cannot be denied that in the Army there
was a certain tendency to oppress the Jews, but it was not at all a
part of any system, was not inspired from above, but sprang up in
the lower strata and in virtue of complex causes, which spread far
outside of the life, customs, and mutual relations of the military
community.</p>

<p>In any case, the war overthrew all barriers, while the revolution
brought with it the repeal, in legislative order, of all religious and
national restrictions.</p>

<p>With the beginning of the revolution and the weakening of the
Government, a violent centrifugal tendency arose in the borderlands
of Russia, and along with it a tendency towards the nationalisation,
<i>i.e.</i>, the dismemberment, of the Army. Undoubtedly, the
need of such dismemberment did not at that time spring from the
consciousness of the masses and had no real foundation (I do not
speak of the Polish formations). The sole motives for nationalisation
then lay in the seeking of the political upper strata of the
newly formed groups to create a real support for their demands,
and in the feeling of self-preservation which urged the military
element to seek in new and prolonged formations a temporary or
permanent relief from military operations. Endless national
military congresses began, without the permission of the Government
and of the High Command. All races suddenly began to
speak; the Lithuanians, the Esthonians, the Georgians, the White
Russians, the Little Russians, the Mohammedans&mdash;demanding
the &ldquo;self-determination&rdquo; proclaimed&mdash;from cultural national
autonomy to full independence inclusive, and principally the
immediate formation of separate bodies of troops. Finally, more
serious results, undoubtedly negative as regards the integrity of
the Army, were attained by the Ukrainian, Polish, and partially by
the Trans-Caucasian formations. The other attempts were nipped
in the bud. It was only during the last days of the existence of
the Russian Army, in October, 1917, that General Shcherbatov,
seeking to preserve the Roumanian front, began the classification
of the Army, on a large scale, according to race&mdash;an attempt which
ended in complete failure. I must add that one race only made
no demand for self-determination with regard to military service&mdash;the
Jewish. And whenever a proposal was made from any source&mdash;in
reply to the complaints of the Jews&mdash;to organise special Jewish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
regiments, this proposal roused a storm of indignation among the
Jews and in the circles of the Left, and was stigmatised as
deliberate provocation.</p>

<p>The Government showed itself markedly opposed to the
reorganisation of the Army according to race. In a letter to the
Polish Congress (June 1st, 1917) Kerensky expressed the following
view: &ldquo;The great achievement of the liberation of Russia and
Poland can be arrived at only under the condition that the organism
of the Russian Army is not weakened, that no alterations in its
organisation infringe its unity.... The extrusion from it of
racial troops ... would, at this difficult moment, tear its
body, break its power, and spell ruin both for the revolution and
for the freedom of Russia, Poland, and of the other nationalities
inhabiting Russia.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The attitude of the commanding element towards the question
of nationalisation was dual. The majority was altogether opposed
to it; the minority regarded it with some hope that, by breaking
their connection with the Council of Workmen&rsquo;s and Soldiers&rsquo;
Delegates, the newly created national units might escape the errors
and infatuations of democratisation and become a healthy nucleus
for fortifying the front and building up the army. General
Alexeiev resolutely opposed all attempts at nationalisation, but
encouraged the Polish and Tchekho-Slovak formations. General
Brussilov allowed the creation of the first Ukrainian formation
on his own responsibility, after requesting the Supreme Commander-in-Chief
&ldquo;not to repeal it and not to undermine his
authority thereby.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> The regiment was allowed to exist. General
Ruzsky, also without permission, began the Esthonian formations,<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
and so forth. From the same motives, probably, which
led some commanders to allow formations, but with a reverse
action, the whole of the Russian revolutionary democracy, in the
person of the Soviets and the army committees, rose against the
nationalisation of the Army. A shower of violent resolutions
poured in from all sides. Among others, the Kiev Council of
Workmen&rsquo;s and Soldiers&rsquo; Delegates, about the middle of April,
characterised Ukrainisation in rude and indignant language, as
simple desertion and &ldquo;hide-saving,&rdquo; and by a majority of
264 against 4 demanded the repeal of the formation of Ukrainian
regiments. It is interesting to note that as great an opponent
of nationalisation was found in the Polish &ldquo;Left,&rdquo; which had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
split off from the military congress of the Poles in June, because
of the resolution for the formation of Polish troops.</p>

<p>The Government did not long adhere to its original firm decision
against nationalisation. The declaration of July 2nd, along with
the grant of autonomy to the Ukraine, also decided the question
of nationalising the troops: &ldquo;The Government considers it
possible to continue its assistance to a closer national union of the
Ukrainians in the ranks of the Army itself, or to the drafting into
individual units of Ukrainians exclusively, in so far as such a
measure does not injure the fighting capacity of the Army ...
and considers it possible to attract to the fulfilment of those
tasks the Ukrainian soldiers themselves, who are sent by the
Central Rada to the War Ministry, the General Staff, and the
Stavka.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A great &ldquo;migration of peoples&rdquo; began.</p>

<p>Other Ukrainian agents journeyed along the front, organising
Ukrainian <i>gromadas</i> and committees, getting resolutions passed
for transfers to Ukrainian units, or concerning reluctance to go
to the front under the plea that &ldquo;the Ukraine was being stifled&rdquo;
and so forth. By October the Ukrainian committee of the Western
front was already calling for armed pressure on the Government
for the immediate conclusion of peace. Petlura affirmed that he
had 50,000 Ukrainian troops at his disposal. Yet the commander
of the Kiev military district, Colonel Oberoutchev,<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> bears witness
as follows: &ldquo;At the time when heroic exertions were being made
to break the foe (the June advance) <i>I was unable to send a single
soldier to reinforce the active army</i>. As soon as I gave an order
to some reserve regiment or other to send detachments to reinforce
the front, a meeting would be called by a regiment which had
until then lived, peaceably, without thinking of Ukrainisation, the
yellow and blue Ukrainian flag would be unfurled and the cry
raised: &lsquo;Let us march under the Ukrainian flag!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And after that they would not move. Weeks would pass, a
month, but the detachments would not stir, either under the red,
or under the blue and yellow flag.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Was it possible to combat this unconcealed care for their own
safety? The answer is given by Oberoutchev again&mdash;an answer
very characteristic in its lifeless party rigour:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, I could have used force to get my orders obeyed.
And that force lay in my hands.&rdquo; But &ldquo;by using force against the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
disobedient, who are acting under the Ukrainian flag, one risks
the reproach that one is struggling not against acts of anarchy,
but against national freedom and the self-determination of nations.
And for me, a Socialist-Revolutionary, to risk such a reproach,
and in the Ukraine too, with which I had been connected all my
life, was impossible. And so I decided to resign.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>And he resigned. True, it was only in October, shortly before
the Bolshevist <i>coup d&rsquo;Ã©tat</i>, having occupied the post of commander
of the troops in the most important district next the front for
nearly five months.</p>

<p>As a development of the orders of the Government, the Stavka
appointed special divisions on each front for Ukrainisation, and
on the South-Western front also the 34th Army Corps, which was
under the command of General Skoropadsky. To these units,
which were mostly quartered in the deep reserve, the soldiers
flocked from the whole front, without leave asked or given. The
hopes of the optimists on the one hand and the fears of the Left
circles on the other that nationalisation would create &ldquo;firm units&rdquo;
(counter-revolutionary in the terminology of the Left) were
speedily dispersed. The new Ukrainian troops were permeated
with the same elements of disintegration as the regulars.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, among the officers and old soldiers of many famous
regiments with a great historical past, now transformed into
Ukrainian units, this measure roused acute pain and the recognition
that the end of the Army was near.<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> In August, when I was
in command of the South-Western front, bad news began to come
to me from the 34th Army Corps. The corps seemed to be
escaping from direct subordination, receiving both directions and
reinforcements from the &ldquo;General Secretary Petlura&rdquo; directly.
His commissary was attached to the Staff of the corps, over which
waved the &ldquo;yellow-blue flag.&rdquo; The former Russian officers and
sergeants, left in the regiments because there was no Ukrainian
command, were treated with contumely by the often ignorant
Ukrainian ensigns set over them and by the soldiers. An extremely
unhealthy atmosphere of mutual hostility and estrangement was
gathering in these units.</p>

<p>I sent for General Skoropadsky and invited him to moderate
the violent course of the process of Ukrainisation and, in particular,
either to restore the rights of the Commanders or to release
them from service in the corps. The future Hetman declared that
a mistaken idea had been formed of his activity, probably because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
of the historical past of the Skoropadsky family,<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> that he was
a true Russian, an officer of the Guards and was altogether free
of all seeking for self-determination, that he was only obeying
orders, for which he himself had no sympathy. But immediately
afterwards Skoropadsky went to the Stavka, whence my Staff
received directions to aid the speedy Ukrainisation of the 34th
Army Corps.</p>

<p>The question of the Polish formations was in a somewhat
different position. The Provisional Government had declared the
independence of Poland, and the Poles now counted themselves
&ldquo;foreigners&rdquo;; Polish formations had long ago existed on the
South-Western front, though they were breaking up (with the
exception of the Polish Lancers); having given permission to the
Ukrainians, the Government could not refuse it to the Poles.
Finally, the Central Powers, by creating the appearance of Polish
independence, also had in view the formation of a Polish Army,
which, however, ended in failure. America also formed a Polish
Army on French territory.</p>

<p>In July, 1917, the formation of a Polish corps was assigned
to the Western front, of which I was then Commander-in-Chief.
At the head of the corps I put General Dovbor-Mousnitsky,<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> who
is now in command of the Polish Army at Poznan. A strong,
energetic, resolute man, who fearlessly waged war on the disintegration
of the Russian troops and on the Bolshevism among
them, he succeeded in a short time in creating units which, if not
altogether firm, were, in any case, strikingly different from the
Russian troops in their discipline and order. It was the old
discipline, rejected by the Revolution&mdash;without meetings, commissaries
or committees. Such units roused another attitude towards
them in the Army, notwithstanding the rejection of nationalisation
in principle. Being supplied with the property of the disbanded
mutinous divisions and treated with complaisance by the Chief of
Supplies, the corps was soon able to organise its own commissariat.
By order, the ranks of the officers in the Polish corps were filled
by the transfer of those who desired it, and the ranks of the soldiers&mdash;exclusively
by volunteers or from reserve battalions; practically,
however, the inevitable current from the front set in, caused by the
same motives which influenced the Russian soldiers, devastating
the thinned ranks of the Army.</p>

<p>In the end the Polish formations turned out to be altogether
useless to us. Even at the June military congress of the Poles,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
fairly unanimous and unambiguous speeches were heard which
defined the aims of these formations. Their synthesis was thus
expressed by one of the delegates: &ldquo;It is a secret for no one that
the War is coming to an end, and we need the Polish Army, not
for the War, not for fighting; we need it so that at the coming
international conference we may be reckoned with, that there
should be power at our backs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And indeed the corps did not make its appearance at the front&mdash;it
is true that it was not yet finally formed; it did not wish to
interfere in the &ldquo;home affairs&rdquo; of the Russians (October and later&mdash;the
struggle against Bolshevism) and soon assumed completely
the position of &ldquo;a foreign army,&rdquo; being taken over and supported
by the French command.</p>

<p>But neither were the hopes of the Polish nationalists fulfilled.
In the midst of the general break-down and fall of the front in
the beginning of 1918 and after the irruption of the Germans into
Russia, part of the corps was captured and disarmed, part of it
dispersed and the remnants of the Polish troops afterwards found
a hospitable asylum in the ranks of the Volunteer Army.</p>

<p>Personally, I cannot but say a good word for the 1st Polish
Corps, to the units of which, quartered in Bykhov, we owe much
in the protection of the lives of General Kornilov and the other
Bykhov prisoners, in the memorable days of September to
November.</p>

<p>Centrifugal forces were scattering the country and the Army. To
class and party intolerance was added the embitterment of national
dissensions, partly based on the historically-created relations
between the races inhabiting Russia and the Imperial Government,
and partly altogether baseless, absurd, fed by causes which had
nothing in common with healthy national feeling. Latent or
crushed at an earlier date, these dissensions broke out rudely at
just that moment, unfortunately, when the general Russian
authority was voluntarily and conscientiously taking the path of
recognition of the historical rights and the national cultural self-determination
of the component elements of the Russian State.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI.</a></h2>

<p class="chapsummary"><span class="smcap">May and the Beginning of June in the Sphere of Military
Administration&mdash;The Resignation of Gutchkov and
General Alexeiev&mdash;My Departure from the Stavka&mdash;The
Administration of Kerensky and General Brussilov.</span></p>

<p>On May 1st the Minister of War, Gutchkov, left his post. &ldquo;We
wished,&rdquo; so he explained the meaning of the &ldquo;democratisation&rdquo;
of the Army which he tried to introduce, &ldquo;to give organised
forms and certain channels to follow, to that awakened spirit of
independence, self-help and liberty which had swept over all. But
there is a line, beyond which lies the beginning of the ruin of that
living, mighty organism which is the Army.&rdquo; Undoubtedly that
line was crossed even before the first of May.</p>

<p>I am not preparing to characterise Gutchkov, whose sincere
patriotism I do not doubt. I am speaking only of the system. It
is difficult to decide who could have borne the heavy weight of
administering the Army during the first period of the Revolution;
but, in any case, Gutchkov&rsquo;s Ministry had not the slightest
grounds to seek the part of guiding the life of the Army. It
did not lead the Army. On the contrary, submitting to a
&ldquo;parallel power&rdquo; and impelled from below, the Ministry, somewhat
restively, <i>followed the Army</i>, until it came right up to the
line, beyond which final ruin begins.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To restrain the Army from breaking up completely under
the influence of that pressure which proceeded from the Socialists,
and in particular from their citadel&mdash;the Soviet of Workmen&rsquo;s and
Soldiers&rsquo; Delegates&mdash;to gain time, to allow the diseased process
to be absorbed, to help the healthy elements to gain strength, such
was my aim,&rdquo; wrote Gutchkov to Kornilov in June, 1917. The
whole question is whether the resistance to the destroying powers
was resolute enough. The Army did not feel this. The officers
read the orders, signed by Gutchkov, which broke up completely
the foundations of military life and custom. That these orders
were the result of a painful internal drama, a painful struggle
and defeat&mdash;this the officers did not know, nor did it interest them.
Their lack of information was so great that many of them even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
now, four years later, ascribe to Gutchkov the authorship of the
celebrated &ldquo;Order No. 1.&rdquo; However it may be, the officers felt
themselves deceived and deserted. Their difficult position they
ascribed principally to the reforms of the Minister of War, against
whom a hostile feeling arose, heated still more by the grumbling
of hundreds of Generals removed by him and of the ultra-monarchical
section of the officers, who could not forgive
Gutchkov his supposed share in the preparation of the Palace
<i>coup d&rsquo;Ã©tat</i> and of the journey to Pskov.<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>Thus the resignation of this Minister, even if caused &ldquo;by those
conditions, in which the Government power was placed in the
country, and in particular the power of the Minister of the Army
and the Navy with respect to the Army and the fleet,&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> had
another justification as well&mdash;the want of support among the
officers and the soldiery.</p>

<p>In a special resolution the Provisional Government condemned
Gutchkov&rsquo;s action in &ldquo;resigning responsibility for the fate of
Russia,&rdquo; and appointed Kerensky Minister of the Army and the
Navy. I do not know how the Army received this appointment
in the beginning, but the Soviet received it without prejudice.
Kerensky was a complete stranger to the art of war and to military
life, but could have been surrounded by honest men; what was
then going on in the Army was simple insanity, and this even a
civilian might have understood. Gutchkov was a representative of
the Bourgeoisie, a Member of the Right, and was distrusted; now,
perhaps, a Socialist Minister, the favourite of the Democracy,
might have succeeded in dissipating the fog in which the soldiers&rsquo;
consciousness was wrapped. Nevertheless, to take up such a
burden called for enormous boldness or enormous self-confidence,
and Kerensky emphasised this circumstance more than once when
speaking to an Army audience: &ldquo;At a time when many soldiers,
who had studied the art of war for decades, declined the post of
Minister of War, I&mdash;a civilian, accepted it.&rdquo; No one, however,
had ever heard that the Ministry of War had been offered to a
soldier that May.</p>

<p>The very first steps taken by the new Minister dissipated our
hopes: the choice of collaborators, who were even greater opportunists
than their predecessors, but void of experience in military
administration and in active service;<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> the surrounding of himself
with men from &ldquo;underground&rdquo;&mdash;perhaps having done very great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
work in the cause of the Revolution, but without any comprehension
of the life of the Army&mdash;all this introduced into the actions
of the War Ministry a new party element, foreign to the military
service.</p>

<p>A few days after his appointment Kerensky issued the Declaration
of the rights of the soldier, thereby predestining the entire
course of his activity.</p>

<p>On May 11th the Minister was passing through Moghilev to
the Front. We were surprised by the circumstance that the passage
was timed for 5 a.m., and that only the Chief-of-Staff was invited
into the train. The Minister of War seemed to avoid meeting
the Supreme Commander-in-Chief. His conversation with me was
short and touched on details&mdash;the suppression of some disturbances
or other that had broken out at one of the railway junctions and
so forth. The most capital questions of the existence of the Army
and of the coming advance, the necessity for unity in the views
of the Government and the Command, the absence of which
was showing itself with such marked clearness&mdash;all this,
apparently, did not attract the attention of the Minister. Among
other things, Kerensky passed a few cursory remarks on the
inappropriateness of Generals Gourko and Dragomirov, Commanders-in-Chief
of fronts, to their posts, which drew a protest
from me. All this was very symptomatic and created at the Stavka
a condition of tense, nervous expectation.</p>

<p>Kerensky was proceeding to the South-Western front, to
begin his celebrated verbal campaign which was to rouse the Army
to achievement. The <i>word</i> created hypnosis and self-hypnosis.
Brussilov reported to the Stavka that throughout the Army the
Minister of War had been received with extraordinary enthusiasm.
Kerensky spoke with unusual pathos and exaltation,
in stirring &ldquo;revolutionary&rdquo; images, often with foam on his lips,
reaping the applause and delight of the mob. At times, however,
the mob would turn to him the face of a wild beast, the sight of
which made words to stick in the throat and caused the heart to
fail. They sounded a note of menace, these moments, but fresh
delight drowned their alarming meaning. And Kerensky reported
to the Provisional Government that &ldquo;the wave of enthusiasm in
the Army is growing and widening,&rdquo; and that a definite change
in favour of discipline and the regeneration of the Army was displaying
itself. In Odessa he became even more irresistibly
poetical: &ldquo;In your welcome I see that great enthusiasm which
has overwhelmed the country and feel that great exaltation which
the world experiences but once in hundreds of years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Let us be just.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span></p>

<p>Kerensky called on the Army to do its duty. He spoke of duty,
honour, discipline, obedience, trust in its commanders; he spoke of
the necessity for advancing and for victory. He spoke in the
language of the established revolutionary ritual, which ought to
have reached the hearts and minds of the &ldquo;revolutionary people.&rdquo;
Sometimes, even, feeling his power over his audience, he would
throw at it the words, which became household words, of
&ldquo;rebel slaves&rdquo; and &ldquo;revolutionary tyrants.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In vain!</p>

<p>At the conflagration of the temple of Russia, he called to the
fire: &ldquo;Be quenched!&rdquo; instead of extinguishing it with brimful
pails of water.</p>

<p>Words could not fight against facts, nor heroic poems against
the stern prose of life. The replacement of the Motherland by
Liberty and Revolution did not make the aims of the conflict any
clearer. The constant scoffing at the old &ldquo;discipline,&rdquo; at the
&ldquo;Czar&rsquo;s generals,&rdquo; the reminders of the knout, the stick, and the
&ldquo;former unprivileged condition of the soldier&rdquo; or of the soldier&rsquo;s
blood &ldquo;shed in vain&rdquo; by someone or other&mdash;nothing of this could
bridge the chasm between the two component parts of the Army.
The passionate preaching of a &ldquo;new, conscious, iron revolutionary
discipline,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i>, a discipline based on the &ldquo;declaration of the rights
of the soldier&rdquo;&mdash;a discipline of meetings, propaganda, political
agitation, absence of authority in the commanders, and so forth&mdash;this
preaching was in irreconcileable opposition to the call to
victory. Having received his impressions in the artificially
exalted, theatrical atmosphere of meetings, surrounded both in
the Ministry and in his journeyings, by an impenetrable wall of
old political friends and of all manner of delegations and
deputations from the Soviets and the Committees, Kerensky
looked on the Army through the prism of their outlook,
either unwilling or unable to sink himself in the real life
of the Army and in its torments, sufferings, searchings, and
crimes, and finally to attain a real standing-ground, get at
vital themes and real words. These everyday questions of Army
life and organisation&mdash;dry in their form and deeply dramatic in
their content&mdash;never served as themes for his speeches. They
contained only a glorification of the Revolution and a condemnation
of certain perversions of the idea of national defence,
created by that Revolution itself. The masses of the soldiery,
eager for sentimental scenes, listened to the appeals of the recognised
chief for self-sacrifice, and they were inflamed with the
&ldquo;sacred fire&rdquo;; but as soon as the scene was over, both the chief
and the audiences reverted to the daily occupations: the chief&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>to
the &ldquo;democratisation&rdquo; of the Army, and the masses&mdash;to
&ldquo;deepening the Revolution.&rdquo; In the same way, probably,
Djerzinsky&rsquo;s executioners in Soviet Russia now admire, in the
temple of proletarian art, the sufferings of young Werther&mdash;before
proceeding to their customary occupation of hanging and shooting.</p>

<p>At any rate, there was much noise. So much, that Hindenburg
sincerely believes even to this day that in June, 1917, the South-Western
Front was commanded by Kerensky. In his book
<i>Aus meinem Leben</i> the German Field-Marshal relates that
Kerensky succeeded Brussilov, &ldquo;who was swept away from his
post by the rivers of Russian blood which he shed in Galicia and
Macedonia (?) in 1916&rdquo; (the Field-Marshal has confused the
theatres of war), and tells the story of Kerensky&rsquo;s &ldquo;advance&rdquo; and
victories over the Austrians near Stanislavov.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Meanwhile life at the Stavka was gradually waning. The
wheels of administration were still revolving, everybody was doing
something, issuing orders and giving directions. The work was
purely formal, because all the plans and directions of the Stavka
were upset by unavoidable and incalculable circumstances. Petrograd
never took the Stavka into serious account, but at that time
the attitude of the Government was somewhat hostile, and the War
Ministry was conducting the work of reorganisation without ever
consulting the Stavka. This position was a great burden to
General Alexeiev, the more so that the attacks of his old disease
became more frequent. He was extremely patient and disregarded
all personal pin-pricks and all efforts at undermining his prerogatives
which emanated from the Government. In his discussions
with numerous Army chiefs, and organisations which took advantage
of his accessibility, he was likewise patient, straightforward,
and sincere. He worked incessantly, in order to preserve the
remnants of the Army. Seeking to give an example of discipline,
he protested but obeyed. He was not sufficiently strong and
masterful by nature to compel the Provisional Government and the
civilian reformers of the Army to take the demands of the Supreme
Command into account; at the same time, he never did violence
to his conscience in order to please the powers that be or the mob.</p>

<p>On May 20th, Kerensky stopped for a few hours at Moghilev on
his way home from the South-Western Front. He was full of
impressions, praised Brussilov, and expressed the view that the
general spirit at the front and the relations between officers and
men were excellent. Although in his conversation with Alexeiev
Kerensky made no hint, we noticed that his entourage was somewhat
uneasy, and realised that decisions in regard to certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
changes had already been taken. I did not consider it necessary
to acquaint the Supreme Commander-in-Chief with these rumours,
and merely seized the first opportunity for postponing his intended
visit to the Western Front so as not to put him into a false position.</p>

<p>In the night of the 22nd a telegram was received dismissing
General Alexeiev and appointing General Brussilov by order of
the Provisional Government. The Quartermaster-General
Josephovitch woke up Alexeiev and handed him the telegram.
The Supreme Commander-in-Chief was deeply moved, and tears
came down his cheeks. May the members of the Provisional
Government who are still alive forgive the vulgarity of the
language: in a subsequent conversation with me the Supreme
Commander-in-Chief inadvertently uttered the following words:
&ldquo;The cads! They have dismissed me like a servant without
notice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A great statesman and military leader had thus left the stage,
whose virtue&mdash;one of many&mdash;was his implicit loyalty (or was it a
defect?) to the Provisional Government.</p>

<p>On the next day Kerensky was asked&mdash;at a meeting of the
Soviet&mdash;what steps he had taken in view of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief&rsquo;s
speech at the officers&rsquo; Conference (see <a href="#CHAPTER_XXIII">Chapter
XXIII</a>). He replied that Alexeiev had been dismissed, and that
he, Kerensky, believed that a late French politician was right in
saying that &ldquo;discipline of duty&rdquo; should be introduced from the
top. The Bolshevik Rosenfeldt (Kamenev) expressed satisfaction,
because this decision fully coincided with the repeated
demands of the Soviet. On the same day the Government
published an official communiquÃ© to the effect that: &ldquo;In spite of
the fact that General Alexeiev was naturally very tired and needed
rest from his arduous labours, it was considered impossible to lose
the services of this exceptionally experienced and talented leader,
and General Alexeiev was therefore to remain at the disposal of
the Provisional Government.&rdquo; The Supreme Commander-in-Chief
issued the following Order of the Day as a farewell to the
Armies.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For nearly three years I have walked with you along the
thorny path of the Russian Army. Your glorious deeds have
filled me with joyful elation, and I was filled with sorrow in the
days of our reverses. But I continued with implicit hope in
Providence, in the mission of the Russian people, and in the
prowess of the Russian soldier. Now that the foundations of our
military power are shattered, I still preserve the same faith, as
life would not be worth living without it. I reverently salute you,
my comrades in arms, all those who have done their duty faith<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>fully,
all those whose hearts beat with the love of their country,
all those who in the days of the popular turmoil were determined
not to allow the Mother Country to be disrupted. I, the old soldier,
and your late Supreme Commander-in-Chief, once more reverently
salute you. Pray think kindly of me.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="right">(Signed) <span class="smcap">General Alexeiev.</span>
</p>

<p>Towards the end of our work in common my intercourse with
General Alexeiev was one of cordial friendship. In parting with
me, he said: &ldquo;All this structure will undoubtedly soon collapse.
You will have to resume work once again. Would you then agree
to work with me again?&rdquo; I naturally expressed my readiness to
collaborate in the future.</p>

<p>Brussilov&rsquo;s appointment signified definite elimination of the
Stavka, as a decisive factor, and a change in its direction.
Brussilov&rsquo;s unrestrained and incomprehensible opportunism, and
his endeavour to gain the reputation of a revolutionary, deprived
the Commanding Staffs of the Army of the moral support which
the former Stavka still gave them. The new Supreme Commander-in-Chief
was given a very frigid and dry reception at Moghilev.
Instead of the customary enthusiastic ovation to which the
&ldquo;Revolutionary General&rdquo; had been accustomed, whom the mob
had carried shoulder high at Kamenetz-Podolsk, he found a lonely
railway station and a strictly conventional parade. Faces were
sulky and speeches were stereotyped. Brussilov&rsquo;s first steps,
insignificant but characteristic episodes, had a further disheartening
effect. As he was reviewing the Guard of Honour of men with
the Cross of St. George, he did not greet their gallant wounded
Commander, Colonel Timanovsky, or the officers, but shook hands
with the men&mdash;the messenger and the orderly. They were so much
perturbed by the unexpected inconvenience of such greetings on
parade that they dropped their rifles. Brussilov handed to me his
Order of the Day intended as a greeting to the Armies, which he
had written in his own hand, and asked me to send it to Kerensky
for approval. In his speech to the members of the Stavka, who
had foregathered to bid farewell to General Alexeiev, Brussilov
tried to make excuses. For excuses they were&mdash;his confused
explanations of the sin of &ldquo;deepening the Revolution&rdquo; with
Kerensky and &ldquo;democratising&rdquo; the Army with the Committees.
The closing sentence of his Order, addressed to the retiring Chief,
sounded, therefore, out of tune: &ldquo;Your name will always remain
unstained and pure as that of a man who has worked incessantly
and has given himself entirely to the service of the Army. In the
dark days of the past and in the present turmoil you have had
the courage, resolutely and loyally, to oppose violence, to combat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
mendacity, flattery, subservience, to resist anarchy in the country
and disruption in the ranks of its defenders.&rdquo;</p>

<p>My activities were disapproved by the Provisional Government
as much as those of General Alexeiev, and I could not work with
Brussilov owing to fundamental differences of opinion. I presume
that during Kerensky&rsquo;s visit to the South-Western Front, Brussilov
agreed with his suggestion of appointing General Lukomsky Chief-of-Staff.
I was therefore surprised at the conversation which took
place on the first day of Brussilov&rsquo;s arrival. He said to me:
&ldquo;Well, General, I thought I was going to meet a comrade-in-arms
and that we were going to work together at the Stavka, but you
look very surly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is not quite true. I cannot stay at the Stavka any
longer. I also know that General Lukomsky is to supersede me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What? How have they dared to appoint him without my
knowledge?&rdquo;</p>

<p>We never touched upon that subject again. I continued to
work with Brussilov for about ten days pending my successor&rsquo;s
arrival, and I must confess that work was unpleasant from the
moral point of view. From the very first days of the War
Brussilov and I had served together. For the first month I was
Quartermaster-General on the Staff of his Eighth Army, then for
two years in command of the 4th Rifle Division in that same
glorious Army, and Commander of the 8th Army Corps on his
front. The &ldquo;Iron Division&rdquo; went from victory to victory, and
Brussilov particularly favoured it and constantly acknowledged
its achievements. His attitude towards the Commander of the
Division was correspondingly cordial. I shared with Brussilov
many hardships as well as many unforgettable happy days of
military triumphs. And I found it difficult to speak to him now,
for he was a different man and was so recklessly, from the personal
point of view&mdash;which, after all, did not matter&mdash;as well as from the
point of view of the interests of the Army, throwing his reputation
to the four winds. When I reported to him, every question which
might be described as &ldquo;un-Democratic,&rdquo; but was, in reality, an
endeavour to maintain the reasonable standard of efficiency, was
invariably negatived. Argument was useless. Brussilov sometimes
interrupted me and said with strong feeling: &ldquo;Do you think
that I am not disgusted at having constantly to wave the Red
rag? What can I do? Russia is sick, the Army is sick. It must
be cured, and I know of no other remedy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The question of my appointment interested him more than
it interested me. I refused to express any definite desire and said
that I would accept any appointment. Brussilov was negotiating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
with Kerensky. He once said to me, &ldquo;<i>They</i> are afraid that if I
give you an appointment at the Front, you will begin to oust the
Committees.&rdquo; I smiled. &ldquo;No, I will not appeal to the Committees
for help, but will also leave them alone.&rdquo; I attributed no
importance to this conversation, which was conducted almost in
jest; but on the same day a telegram was sent to Kerensky, of which
the following was the approximate wording: &ldquo;I have talked it
over with Deniken. The obstacles have been removed. I request
that he be appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Western Front.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="caption">Kerensky addressing soldiers&rsquo; meeting.</p></div>

<p>In the beginning of August I proceeded to Minsk and took
General Markov as Chief-of-Staff of the Front. I had no regrets
in leaving the Stavka. For two months I had worked like a slave
and my outlook had widened, but had I achieved anything for the
preservation of the Army? Positive results were nil. There may
have been some negative results; the process of disruption of the
Army had been to a certain extent stayed. And that is all. One
of Kerensky&rsquo;s assistants, afterwards High Commissar, Stankevitch,
thus describes my activities: &ldquo;Nearly every week telegrams
were sent to Petrograd (by Deniken) containing provocative and
harsh criticisms on the new methods in the Army; criticisms they
were, not advice. Is it possible to advise that the Revolution
should be cancelled.&rdquo; If that was only Stankevitch discussing
Denikin it would not matter. But these views were shared by the
wide circles of the Revolutionary Democracy and referred not to
the individual, but to all those who &ldquo;impersonated the tragedy
of the Russian Army.&rdquo; The appreciation must therefore be
answered.</p>

<p>Yes, the Revolution could not be cancelled, and what is more,
I may state that the majority of the Russian officers, with whom
I agreed, <i>did not wish to cancel the Revolution</i>. They demanded
one thing only&mdash;that the Army should not be revolutionised from
the top. None of us could give any other advice. And if the
Commanding Staffs appeared to be &ldquo;insufficiently tied to the
Revolution&rdquo; they should have been mercilessly dismissed and
other people&mdash;were they but unskilled artisans in military matters&mdash;should
have been appointed, and given full power and confidence.</p>

<p>Personalities do not matter. Alexeiev, Brussilov, Kornilov&mdash;represent
periods and systems. Alexeiev protested. Brussilov
submitted. Kornilov claimed. In dismissing these men one after
another did the Provisional Government have a definite idea, or
were they simply distracted to the point of convulsion and completely
lost in the morass of their own internal dissensions?
Would it not appear that had the order been changed in which
the links had stood in that chain salvation might have ensued?</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII.</a><br />
<span class="smcap">My Term as Commander-in-Chief on the Western Russian
Front.</span></h2>

<p>I took over the Command from General Gourko. His
removal had already been decided on May 5th, and an Order
of the Day had been drafted at the War Ministry. Gourko, however,
sent a report in which he stated that it was impossible for him
to remain morally responsible for the armies under his command
in the present circumstances (after the &ldquo;Declaration of the
Soldier&rsquo;s Rights&rdquo; had been issued). This report afforded Kerensky
an excuse for issuing on May 26th an order relieving Gourko of
his post and appointing him to the command of a division. The
motive was adduced that Gourko was &ldquo;not up to the mark,&rdquo; and
that &ldquo;as the country was in danger, every soldier should do his
duty and not be an example of weakness to others.&rdquo; Also that
&ldquo;the Commander-in-Chief enjoys the full confidence of the
Government, and should apply all his energies to the task of
carrying out the intentions of the Government; to decline to bear
the moral responsibility was on General Gourko&rsquo;s part tantamount
to dereliction of duty, which he should have continued to perform
according to his strength and judgment.&rdquo; Not to speak of the
fact that Gourko&rsquo;s dismissal had already been decided, suffice it
to recall similar instances, such as the resignations of Gutchkov
and Miliukov, in order to realise the hypocrisy of these excuses.
And what is more&mdash;Kerensky himself, during one of the Government
crises caused by the uncompromising attitude of the
&ldquo;Revolutionary Democracy,&rdquo; had threatened to resign, and had
stated in writing to his would-be successor, Nekrassov, that:
&ldquo;Owing to the impossibility of introducing into the Government
such elements as were required in the present exceptional circumstances,
he could no longer bear the responsibility before the
country according to his conscience and judgment, and requested
therefore to be relieved of all his duties.&rdquo; The papers said that
he had &ldquo;departed from Petrograd.&rdquo; On October 28th, as we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
know, Kerensky fled, abandoning the post of Supreme
Commander-in-Chief.</p>

<p>The old Commanding Staffs were in a difficult position. I refer
not to men of definite political convictions, but of the average
honest soldier. They could not follow Kerensky (the system, not
the man) and destroy with their own hands the edifice which they
had themselves spent their lives in building. They could not
resign because the enemy was on Russian soil and they would be
deserters according to their own conscience. It was a vicious
circle.</p>

<p>Upon my arrival at Minsk I addressed two large gatherings of
members of the Staff and departments of the Front, and later the
Army Commanders, and expounded my fundamental views. I
did not say much, but stated clearly that I accepted the Revolution
without any reservations. I considered, however, that to
&ldquo;revolutionise&rdquo; the Army was a fatal procedure, and that to
introduce demagogy into the Army would mean the ruin of the
Country. I declared that I would oppose it with all my might
and invited my collaborators to do the same. I received a letter
from General Alexeiev, who wrote: &ldquo;Congratulations on your
appointment. Rouse them! Make your demands calmly but
persistently. I trust that the revival will come without coaxing,
without red ribbons, without sonorous and empty phrases. The
Army cannot continue as it is now, for Russia is being transformed
into a multitude of idlers who have an exaggerated idea of their
own importance (value their movements in gold). I am in heart
and in thought with you, with your work and with your wishes.
God help you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Committee of the Front impersonated at Minsk &ldquo;Military
Politics.&rdquo; On the eve of my arrival that semi-Bolshevik organisation
had passed a resolution protesting against an advance and
in favour of the struggle of united democracies against their
Governments; this naturally helped to define my attitude towards
that body. I had no direct intercourse with the Committee, which
&ldquo;stewed in its own juice,&rdquo; argued the matter of preponderant
influences of the Social Democratic and Social Revolutionary
factions, passed resolutions which puzzled even the Army Committees
by their demagogic contents, distributed defeatist
pamphlets, and incensed the men against their chiefs. According
to the law, the Committees were not responsible and could not
be tried. The Committee was educating in the same sense the
pupils of the &ldquo;school for agitators,&rdquo; who were afterwards to
spread these doctrines along the Front. I will quote one instance
showing the real meaning of these manifestations &ldquo;of civic indig<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>nation
and sorrow.&rdquo; Pupils of the school often appealed to the
Chief-of-Staff and sent in &ldquo;demands.&rdquo; On one occasion the
demand for an extra pair of boots was couched in offensive terms.
General Markov refused it. On the next day a resolution was
published (in the paper <i>The Front</i>, No. 25) of the Conference of
Pupils of the School of Agitators to the effect that they had
personally tested the reluctance of Headquarters to take elective
organisations into account. The pupils declared that the Committee
of the Front will find in them and in those who sent them
full support against &ldquo;counter-revolution,&rdquo; and even armed
assistance.</p>

<p>Was work in common possible in these circumstances?</p>

<p>The idea of the advance was finally, however, accepted by the
Committee of the Front, which demanded that from itself and
from Army Committees &ldquo;fighting committees of contact&rdquo; be
established which would be entitled to partake in the drafting of
plans of operations to control the Commanding Officers and Headquarters
of the advancing troops, etc. I naturally refused the
request, and a conflict ensued. The War Minister was very much
perturbed, and sent to Minsk the Chief of his Chancery, Colonel
Baronovsky, a young staff officer who prompted Kerensky in all
military matters, and the Commissar Stankevitch, who remained
at the Western Front for two days, was removed to the Northern
Front and replaced by Kalinin. Baronovsky&rsquo;s friends afterwards
told me that the question of my dismissal had been raised in view
of &ldquo;friction with the Committee of the Front.&rdquo; Stankevitch
appeased the Committee and &ldquo;fighting committees of contact&rdquo;
were allowed to take part in the advance, but were denied the right
of control over the operations and of assisting in drawing up plans.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Of the three Army Commanders at that Front, two were entirely
in the hands of the Committees. As their sectors were inactive,
their presence could be temporarily tolerated. The advance was
to begin on the Front of the 10th Army, commanded by General
Kisselevsky, in the region of Molodetchno. I inspected the troops
and the position, interviewed the Commanding Officers and
addressed the troops. In the preceding chapters I have recounted
impressions, facts, and episodes of the life of the Western front.
I will, therefore, mention here only a few details. I saw the troops
on parade. Some units had preserved the appearance and the
routine of the normal pre-Revolutionary times. These, however,
were exceptions, and were to be found chiefly in the Army Corps of
General Dovbor-Mussnitzki, who was persistently and sternly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
maintaining the old discipline. Most of the units, however, were
more akin to a devastated ants-nest than to an organised unit,
although they had retained a semblance of discipline and drill.
After the review I walked down the ranks and spoke to the soldiers.
I was deeply depressed by their new mental attitude. Their
speeches were nought but endless complaints, suspicions and
grievances against everyone and everything. They complained
of all the officers, from the Platoon Commander to the Army Corps
Commander, complained of the lentil soup, of having to stand at
the Front for ever, of the next regiment of the line, and of the
Provisional Government for being implacably hostile to the
Germans. I witnessed scenes which I shall not forget till my last
hour. In one of the Army Corps I asked to be shown the worst
unit. I was taken to the 703rd Suram Regiment. We drove up
to a huge crowd of unarmed men who were standing, sitting,
wandering about the plain behind the village. Having sold their
clothes for cash or for drink, they were dressed in rags, bare-footed,
ragged, unkempt, and seemed to have reached the utmost
limit of physical degradation. I was met by the Divisional
Commander, whose lower lip trembled, and by a Regimental
Commander who had the face of a condemned man. Nobody gave
the order &ldquo;Attention!&rdquo; and none of the soldiers rose. The
nearest ranks moved towards our motor cars. My first impulse
was to curse the regiment and turn back. But that might have
been interpreted as cowardice, so I went into the thick of the
crowd. I stayed there for about an hour. Good Heavens, what
was the matter with these men, with the reasonable creature of
God, with the Russian field-labourer? They were like men possessed,
their brain dimmed, their speech stubborn and completely
lacking logic or common-sense; their shrieks were hysterical, full
of abuse and foul swearing. We tried to speak, but the replies
were angry and stupid. I remember that my feelings of indignation
as an old soldier receded to the background and I merely
felt infinitely sorry for these uncouth, illiterate Russians to whom
little was given and of whom little will, therefore, be asked. One
wished that the leaders of the Revolutionary Democracy had been
on that plain and had seen and heard everything. One wished
one could have said to them: &ldquo;It is not the time to find out who
is guilty, it doesn&rsquo;t matter whether the guilt is ours, yours, of the
bourgeoisie or of autocracy. Give the people education and an
&lsquo;image of man&rsquo; first, and then socialise, nationalise, Communise,
if the people will then follow you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The same Suram Regiment, a few days later, gave a sound
thrashing to Sokolov, the man who drafted Order No. 1, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
creator of the new rÃ©gime for the Army, because he demanded,
in the name of the Soviet, that the regiment should do its duty
and join in the advance.</p>

<p>After visiting the regiment, in compliance with persistent
invitations from a special delegation, I went to a Conference of
the 2nd Caucasian Army Corps. The members of that Conference
had been elected; their discussions were more reasonable
and their aims more practical. Among the various groups of
delegates whom our <i>aides-de-camp</i> had joined, the argument was
put forward that, as the Commander-in-Chief and all the senior
Commanding Officers were present, would it not be expedient to
finish them off at once? That would put an end to the advance.</p>

<p>To meet the senior Commanding Officer was by no means
a consolation. One of the Army Corps Commanders led his troops
with a firm hand, but experienced strong pressure from the Army
organisations; another was afraid to visit his troops. I found
the third in a state of complete collapse and in tears because someone
had passed a vote of censure upon him: &ldquo;And this after forty
years&rsquo; service! I loved the men and they loved me, but now they
have dishonoured me, and I cannot serve any longer!&rdquo; I had to
allow him to retire. In the next room a young Divisional Commander
was already in secret consultation with members of the
Committee, who immediately requested me, in a most peremptory
fashion, to appoint the young General to the command of the
Army Corps.</p>

<p>The visit left me with a painful impression. Disruption was
growing and my hopes were waning; and yet one had to continue
the work, of which there was plenty for all of us. The Western
Front lived by theory and by the experience of others. It had won
no striking victories, which alone can inspire confidence in the
methods of warfare, and had no real experience in breaking
through the defensive line of the enemy. One was very often
compelled to discuss the general plan, the plan of artillery attack,
and to establish the points of initiative with those who were to
carry out the general plan. We found the greatest difficulty in
preparing the plans for storming a position. Owing to demoralisation,
every movement of troops, every relief, trench digging,
bringing batteries into position, either were not carried out at all,
or else attended by delays, tremendous efforts or persuasion, and
meetings. Every slightest excuse was made use of in order to
avoid preparations for the advance. Owing to the technical unpreparedness
of the positions, the chiefs had to perform the arduous
and unnatural task of making tactical considerations subservient
to the qualities of the Commanding Officers, instead of giving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
directions to the troops in accordance with tactical considerations.
The degree of the demoralisation of different units and the condition
of different sectors of a given firing line, purely accidental,
had also to be taken into account. And yet the statement that our
technical backwardness was one of the reasons of our collapse in
1917 should be accepted with reservations. Of course, our Army
was backward, but in 1917 it was infinitely better equipped, had
more guns and ammunition and wider experience of her own and
of other fronts than in 1916. Our technical backwardness was a
relative factor which was present at all times in the Great War
before the Revolution, but was remedied in 1917, and cannot,
therefore, be taken into account as a decisive feature in estimating
the Russian Revolutionary Army and its work in the field.</p>

<p>It was the work of Sisyphus. The Commanding Officers gave
their heart and soul to the work because in its success they saw
the last ray of hope for the salvation of the Army and of the
country. Technical difficulties could be overcome, as long as the
moral could be raised.</p>

<p>Brussilov arrived and addressed the regiment. As a result,
the officer commanding the 10th Army was relieved against my
will ten days before the decisive advance. And it was not without
difficulty that I secured the appointment of General Lomnovsky,
the gallant Commander of the 8th Army Corps, who had arrived
at the Front ten days before the action. There was an unpleasant
misunderstanding about Brussilov&rsquo;s visit. Headquarters had
mistakenly informed the troops that Kerensky was coming. This
substitution provoked strong discontent among the troops.
Many units declared that they were being deceived, and that unless
Comrade Kerensky himself orders them to advance they would
not advance. The 2nd Caucasian Division sent delegates to
Petrograd to make inquiries. And efforts had to be made to
appease them by promising that Comrade Kerensky was due to
arrive in a few days. The War Minister had to be invited.
Kerensky came reluctantly, because he was already disillusioned
by the failure of his oratorical campaign on the South-Western
Front. For several days he reviewed the troops, delivered
speeches, was enthusiastically received and sometimes unexpectedly
rebuked. He interrupted his tour, as he was invited to hurry to
Petrograd on July 4th, but he returned with renewed energy and
with a new up-to-date theme, making full use of the &ldquo;knife with
which the Revolution had been stabbed in the back&rdquo; (the Petrograd
rising of July 3rd-5th). Having, however, completed his tour
and returned to the Stavka, he emphatically declared to Brussilov:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have no faith whatsoever in the success of the advance.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span></p>

<p>Kerensky was equally pessimistic in those days with regard
to another matter, the future destinies of the country. He
discussed in conversation with myself and two or three of his
followers, the stages of the Russian Revolution, and expressed
the conviction that whatever happened we should not escape the
Reign of Terror. The days went by and the advance was further
delayed. As early as on June 18th, I issued the following Order
of the Day to the Armies of my Front:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Russian Army of the South-Western Front have this
day defeated the enemy and broken through his lines. A decisive
battle has begun on which depends the fate of the Russian people
and of its liberties. Our brethren on the South-Western Front
are victoriously advancing, sacrificing their lives and expecting us
to render them speedy assistance. We shall not be traitors. The
enemy shall soon hear the roaring of our guns. I appeal to the
troops of the Western Front to make every effort and to prepare
as soon as possible for an advance, otherwise we shall be cursed
by the Russian people who have entrusted to us the defence of
their liberty, honour, and property.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I do not know whether those who read this order, published
in the papers in complete contravention of all the conditions of
secrecy of operation, understood all the inner tragedy of the
Russian Army. All strategy was turned topsy-turvy. The
Russian Commander-in-Chief, powerless to advance his troops
and thus alleviate the position of the neighbouring Front, wanted
(even at the cost of exposing his intentions) to hold the German
divisions which were being moved from his Front and sent to the
South-Western and the Allied Front.</p>

<p>The Germans responded immediately by sending the following
proclamation to the Front:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Russian soldiers! Your Commander-in-Chief of the Western
Front is again calling on you to fight. We know of his order,
and also know of the false report that our line to the South-East
of Lvov has been broken. Do not believe it. In reality
thousands of Russian corpses are lying before our trenches. An
advance will never lead to peace. If, nevertheless, you obey the
call of your commanders, who are bribed by England, then we
shall continue the struggle until you are overthrown.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Finally, on July 8th, the thunder of our guns was heard. On
July 9th the storming began, and three days after I was on my way
from the 10th Army to Minsk, with despair in my heart, and
clearly recognising that the last hope of a miracle was gone.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII.</a><br />
<span class="smcap">The Russian Advance in the Summer of 1917&mdash;The DÃ©bÃ¢cle.</span></h2>

<p>The Russian offensive which had been planned for the month
of May was being delayed. At first a simultaneous advance
on all fronts had been contemplated; later, however, owing to
the psychological impossibility of a forward movement on all
fronts, it was decided to advance gradually. The Western Front
was of secondary importance, and the Northern was intended
only for demonstration. They should have moved first in order
to divert the attention and the forces of the enemy from the
main front&mdash;the South-Western. The first two of the above-named
fronts were not, however, ready for the advance. The
Supreme Command finally decided to abandon the strategical plan
and to give the commanders of various fronts a free hand in starting
operations as the Armies would be ready, provided these
operations were not delayed too long and the enemy was not
given the opportunity of carrying out re-groupings on a large
scale.</p>

<p>Even such a strategy, simplified as it had been owing to the
Revolution, might have yielded great results, considering the
world-wide scope of the War; if the German Armies on the
Eastern Front could not have been utterly defeated, that Front
might at least have been restored to its former importance. The
Central Powers might have been compelled to send to that Front
large forces, war material and munitions, thus severely handicapping
Hindenburg&rsquo;s strategy and causing him constant anxiety.
The operations were finally fixed for the following dates: They
were to begin on the South-Western Front on June 16th, on the
Western on July 7th, on the Northern on July 8th, and on the
Roumanian on July 6th. The last three dates almost coincide
with the beginning of the collapse (July 6th-7th) of the South-Western
Front.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, in June, 1917, the Revolutionary
Democracy had already acquiesced in the idea that an advance
was necessary, although this acquiescence was qualified. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
offensive thus had the moral support of the Provisional Government,
the Commanding Staffs, all the officers, the Liberal
Democracy, the Defencist Coalition of the Soviet, the Commissars,
of nearly all Army Committees, and of many Regimental
Committees. Against the offensive the minority of the
Revolutionary Democracy was ranged&mdash;the Bolsheviks, the Social-Revolutionaries
of Tchernov&rsquo;s and of Martov&rsquo;s (Zederbaum)
group. There was a small appendix to this minority&mdash;the
Democratisation of the Army.</p>

<p>At the moment of writing I do not possess a complete list
of the Russian Armies, but I may confidently assert that on all
sectors upon which the advance had been planned we had a
numerical and a technical superiority over the enemy, more
especially in guns, of which we had larger quantities than ever.
It fell to the lot of the South-Western Front to test the fighting
capacity of the Revolutionary Army.</p>

<p>The group of armies under General Bohm-Ermolli (the 4th and
2nd Austrian Armies and the Southern German Armies) stood
between the upper Sereth and the Carpathians (Brody-Nadvorna)
on the position north of the Dniester which we had captured after
Brussilov&rsquo;s victorious advance in the autumn of 1916. South of
the Dniester stood the 3rd Austrian Army of General Kirchbach,
which formed the Left Wing of the Archduke Joseph&rsquo;s Carpathian
Front. Our best Army Corps, which were intended as shock
troops, were opposed to the last three Armies mentioned above.
These Austro-German troops had already been dealt many heavy
blows by the Russian Armies in the summer and in the autumn of
1916. Since then, the Southern German Divisions of General
Botmer, which had been hard hit, had been replaced by
fresh troops from the North. Although the Austrian Armies
had been to a certain extent reorganised by the German High
Command and reinforced by German divisions, they did not represent
a formidable force and, according to the German Headquarters,
were not fit for active operations.</p>

<p>Since the Germans had occupied the Cherviche &ldquo;Place
d&rsquo;armes&rdquo; on the Stokhod, Hindenburg&rsquo;s Headquarters had given
orders that no operations should be conducted, as it was hoped
that the disruption of the Russian Army and of the country would
follow its natural course, assisted by German propaganda. The
Germans estimated the fighting capacity of our Army very low.
Nevertheless, when Hindenburg realised in the beginning of June
that a Russian advance was a contingency to be reckoned with,
he moved six divisions from the Western-European front and
sent them to reinforce the group of Armies of Bohm-Ermolli.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
The enemy was perfectly well aware of the directions in which we
intended to advance....</p>

<p>The Russian Armies of the South-Western Front, commanded
by General Gutor, were to strike in the main direction of
Kamenetz-Podolsk-Lvov. The Armies were to move along both
banks of the Dniester: General Erdely&rsquo;s 11th Army in the direction
of Zlochev, General Selivatchev&rsquo;s 7th Army towards Brjeczany,
and General Kornilov&rsquo;s 8th Army towards Galitch. In the event
of victory we would reach Lvov, break through between the fronts
of Bohm-Ermolli and the Archduke Joseph, and would drive the
latter&rsquo;s left wing to the Carpathians, cutting it off from all
available natural means of communication. The remainder of our
Armies on the South-Western Front were stretched along a broad
front from the river Pripet to Brody for active defence and
demonstration.</p>

<p>On June 16th the guns of the shock troops of the 7th and
11th Army opened a fire of such intensity as had never been heard
before. After two days of continuous fire, which destroyed the
enemy&rsquo;s strong position, the Russian regiments attacked. The
enemy line was broken between Zvorov and Brjeczany on a front
of several miles; we took two or three fortified lines. On
June 19th the attack was renewed on a front of forty miles, between
the Upper Strypa and the Narauvka. In this heavy and glorious
battle the Russian troops took three hundred officers and eighteen
thousand men prisoners in two days, twenty-nine guns, and other
booty. The enemy positions were captured on many sectors, and
we penetrated the enemy lines to an average depth of over two
miles, driving him back to the Strypa in the direction of Zlochev.</p>

<p>The news of our victory spread all over Russia, evoked
universal rejoicings, and raised the hopes for the revival of the
former strength of the Russian Army. Kerensky reported to the
Provisional Government as follows: &ldquo;This day is the day of a
great triumph for the Revolution. On June 18th the Russian
Revolutionary Army, in very high spirits, began the advance and
has proved before Russia and before the world its ardent devotion
to the cause of the Revolution and its love of Country and Liberty....
The Russian warriors are inaugurating a new discipline
based upon feelings of a citizen&rsquo;s duty.... An end has been
made to-day of all the vicious calumnies and slander about the
organisation of the Russian Army, which has been rebuilt on
Democratic lines....&rdquo; The man who wrote these words had
afterwards the courage to claim that it was not he who had
destroyed the Army, because he had taken over the organisation
as a fatal inheritance!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span></p>

<p>After three days&rsquo; respite, a violent battle was resumed on the
front of the 11th Army on both sides of the railway line on the
front Batkuv-Koniuchi. By that time the threatened German
regiments were reinforced, and stubborn fighting ensued. The
11th Army captured several lines, but suffered heavy losses. The
trenches changed hands several times after a hand-to-hand battle,
and great efforts had to be made in order to break the resistance
of the enemy, who had been reinforced and had recovered. This
action practically signified the end of the advance of the 7th and
11th Armies. The impetus was spent and the troops began once
more to sit in the trenches, the monotony of this pastime being
only broken in places by local skirmishes, Austro-German counter-attacks,
and intermittent gunfire. Meanwhile preparations for the
advance began on June 23rd in Kornilov&rsquo;s Army. On June 25th
his troops broke through General Kirchbach&rsquo;s positions west of
Stanislavov and reached the line of Jesupol-Lyssetz. After a
stubborn and sanguinary battle Kirchbach&rsquo;s troops, utterly
defeated, ran and dragged along in their headlong flight the
German division which had been sent to reinforce them. On the
27th General Cheremissov&rsquo;s right column captured Galitch, some
of his troops crossed the Dniester. On the 28th the left column
overcame the stubborn resistance of the Austro-Germans and
captured Kalush. In the next two or three days, the 8th Army
was in action on the river Lomnitza and finally established itself
on the banks of the river and in front of it. In the course of this
brilliant operation Kornilov&rsquo;s Army broke through the 3rd
Austrian Army on a front of over twenty miles and captured
150 officers, 10,000 men, and about 100 guns. The capture of
Lomnitza opened to Kornilov the road to Dolina-Stryi and to the
communications of Botmer&rsquo;s Army. German Headquarters
described the position of the Commander-in-Chief of the Western
Front as <i>critical</i>.</p>

<p>General Bohm-Ermolli meanwhile was concentrating all his
reserves in the direction of Zlochev, the point to which the German
divisions were likewise sent which had been taken from the
Western European Front. Some of the reserves had to be sent,
however, across the Dniester against the 8th Russian Army.
They arrived on July 2nd, reinforced the shattered ranks of the
3rd Austrian Army, and from that day positional battles began on
the Lomnitza, with varying success, and occasionally stubborn
fighting. The concentration of the German shock troops between
the Upper Sereth and the railway line Tarnopol-Zlochev was completed
on July 5th. On the next day, after strong artillery
preparations, this group attacked our 11th Army, broke our front<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
and moved swiftly towards Kamenetz-Podolsk, pursuing the Army
Corps of the 11th Army who were fleeing in panic. The Army
Headquarters, the Stavka and the Press, losing all perspective,
blamed the 607th Mlynov Regiment as the chief cause of the
catastrophe. The demoralised, worthless regiment had left the
trenches of their own accord and opened the front. It was, of
course, a very sad occurrence, but it would be naÃ¯ve to describe it
even as an excuse. For as early as on the 9th of July the Committees
and Commissars of the 11th Army were telegraphing to
the Provisional Government: &ldquo;The truth and nothing but the
truth about the events.&rdquo; &ldquo;The German offensive on the front
of the 11th Army, which began on July 6th, is growing into an
immeasurable calamity which threatens perhaps the very existence
of Revolutionary Russia. The spirit of the troops, that were
prompted to advance by the heroic efforts of the minority, has
undergone a decisive and fatal change. The impetus of the
advance was soon spent. Most of the units are in a condition of
increasing disruption. There is not a shadow of discipline or
obedience; persuasion is likewise powerless and is answered by
threats and sometimes by shootings. Cases have occurred when
orders to advance immediately to reinforce the line were debated
for hours at meetings, and reinforcements were twenty-four hours
late. Some units arbitrarily leave the trenches without even waiting
for the enemy to advance.... For hundreds of miles
strings of deserters&mdash;healthy, strong men who thoroughly realise
their impunity&mdash;are to be seen moving along with rifles or without....
The country should know the whole truth. It will
shudder and will find the strength to fall with all its might upon
all those whose cowardice is ruining and bartering Russia and
the Revolution.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Stavka wrote: &ldquo;In spite of its enormous numerical and
technical superiority, the 11th Army was retreating uninterruptedly.
On the 8th of July it had already reached the Serenth, never halting
at the very strong fortified position to the West of the river, which
had been our starting point in the glorious advance of 1916. Bohm-Ermolli
had detached some of his forces for the pursuit of the
Russian troops in the direction of Tarnapol and had moved his
main forces southwards between the Serenth and the Strypa,
threatening to cut off the communication of the 7th Army, to throw
them into the Dniester and, perhaps, cut off the retreat of the
8th Army. On July 9th the Austro-Germans had already reached
Mikulinze, a distance of one march south of Tarnapol.... The
Armies of General Selivatchev and Cheremissov (who had succeeded
General Kornilov upon the latter&rsquo;s appointment on July 7th to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
High Command of the South-Western Front) were in great
difficulty. They could not hope to resist the enemy by man&oelig;uvring,
and all that was left to them was to escape the enemy&rsquo;s blows by
forced marches. The 7th Army was in particularly dire straits, as
it was retreating under the double pressure of the Army Corps of
General Botmer, who was conducting a frontal attack, and of the
troops of Bohm-Ermolli, striking from the north against the
denuded right flank. The 8th Army had to march over one hundred
miles under pressure from the enemy.</p>

<p>On July 10th the Austro-Germans advanced to the line
Mikulinze-Podgaitze-Stanilavov. On the 11th the Germans
occupied Tarnapol, abandoned without fighting by the 1st Guards
Army Corps. On the next day they broke through our position
on the rivers Gniezno and Sereth, South of Trembovlia, and
developed their advance in the Eastern and South-Eastern directions.
On the same day, pursuing the 7th and 8th Armies, the
enemy occupied the line from the Sereth to Monsaterjisko-Tlumatch.</p>

<p>On the 12th July, seeing that the position was desperate, the
Commander-in-Chief issued orders for a retreat from the Sereth,
and by the 21st the Armies of the South-Western Front, having
cleared Galicia and Bukovina, reached the Russian frontier. Their
retreat was marked by fires, violence, murders and plunder. A few
units, however, fought the enemy stubbornly and covered the
retreat of the maddened mob of deserters by sacrificing their lives.
Among them were Russian officers, whose bodies covered the
battlefields. The Armies were retreating in disorder; the same
Armies that, only a year ago, had captured Lutsk, Brody-Stanislavov,
Chernovetz in their triumphal progress ... were retreating
before the same Austro-German troops that only a year ago
had been completely defeated and had strewn with fugitives the
plains of Volynia, Galicia and Bukovina, leaving hundreds of
thousands of prisoners in our hands. We shall never forget that
in Brussilov&rsquo;s advance of 1916, the 7th, 8th, 9th and 11th Armies
took 420,000 prisoners, 600 guns, 2,500,000 machine guns, etc.
Our Allies are not likely to forget this either; they know full well
that the loud echo of the Galician battle sounded on the Somme
and at Goritza.</p>

<p>The Commissars Savinkov and Filonenko telegraphed to the
Provisional Government: &ldquo;There is no choice; the traitors must
be executed.... Capital punishment must be meted out to all
those who refuse to sacrifice their lives for their country....&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the beginning of July, after the Russian advance had ostensibly
failed, it was decided at Hindenburg&rsquo;s Headquarters to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
undertake a new extensive operation against the Roumanian front
by a simultaneous advance of the 3rd and 7th Austrian Armies
across Bukovina into Moldavia and of the Right group of General
Mackensen on the Lower Sereth. The objective was to seize
Moldavia and Bessarabia. But on July 11th the Russian Army of
General Ragosa and the Roumanian Army of General Averesco
took the offensive between the rivers Susitsa and Putna against the
9th Austrian Army. The attack was successful, the enemy
positions were captured, the Armies moved forward several miles,
took 2,000 prisoners and over 60 guns, but the operation was not
developed. Owing to the natural conditions of the theatre of war
and to the direction in which the operation was undertaken, it was
more akin to a demonstration in order to relieve the South-Western
Front. Also the troops of the 4th Russian Army soon lost all
impetus for the advance. In July and until August 4th, the troops
of the Archduke Joseph and of Mackensen attacked in several
directions and gained local successes, but without any appreciable
result. Although the Russian divisions repeatedly disobeyed
orders and occasionally left the trenches during the battle, yet the
condition of the Roumanian Front was somewhat better than that
of the other Front, owing to its distance from Petrograd, to the
presence of disciplined Roumanian troops and to the natural
conditions of the country. For these reasons we were able to keep
that Front somewhat longer. This circumstance, together with the
apparent weakness of the Austrian Armies, especially the 3rd and
the 7th, and the complete dislocation of the communications of
Bohm-Ermolli&rsquo;s group and of the Archduke Joseph&rsquo;s left wing&mdash;caused
Hindenburg&rsquo;s Headquarters indefinitely to postpone the
operation, and a period of calm ensued along the entire South-Western
Front. On the Roumanian Front local actions were fought
until the end of August. At the same time, German divisions
began to move from the Sbrucz northwards in the direction of
Riga. Hindenburg&rsquo;s plan was to deal the Russian Army local
blows, without straining his own resources or spending large
reserves, so urgently needed, on the Western-European Front. By
these tactics he intended to contribute to the natural course of the
collapse of the Russian front, for it was upon this collapse that
the Central Powers based all their calculations in regard to
operations and even in regard to the possibility of continuing the
campaign in 1918.</p>

<p>Our efforts at advancing on other Fronts also ended in complete
failure. On the 7th of July operations began on the Western Front,
which I commanded. The details will be given in the next chapter.
Of this operation Ludendorf wrote: &ldquo;Of all the attacks directed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
against the former Eastern front of General Eichhorn, the attacks
of July 9th, South of Smorgom, and at Krevo were particularly
fierce.... For several days the position was extremely difficult
until our reserves and our gunfire restored the front. The Russians
left our trenches; they were no longer the Russians of the old
days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the Northern Front, in the 5th Army, everything was over in
one day. The Stavka wrote: &ldquo;South-West of the Dvinsk our
troops, after strong artillery preparation, captured the German
position across the railway Dvinsk-Vilna. Subsequently, entire
divisions, without pressure from the enemy, deliberately retreated
to their own trenches.&rdquo; The Stavka noted the heroic behaviour
of several units, the prowess of the officers and the tremendous
losses which the latter had suffered. This fact, however unimportant
from the strategical point of view, deserves to be specially
noted. As a matter of fact, the 5th Army was commanded by
General Danilov (afterwards a member of the Bolshevik Delegation
at Brest-Litovsk. He served in 1920 in the Russian Army
in the Crimea). He enjoyed exceptional prestige with the Revolutionary
Democracy. According to Stankevitch, the Commissar
of the Northern Front, Danilov &ldquo;was the only General who had
remained, in spite of the Revolution, full master in the Army and
had succeeded in so dealing with the new institutions&mdash;the Commissars
and the Committees&mdash;that they strengthened his authority
instead of weakening it.... He knew how to make use of
these elements, and he overcame all obstacles in a spirit of complete
self-control and firmness. In the 5th Army everyone was working,
learning and being educated.... As the best and the most
cultured elements of the Army were working to that end.&rdquo; This
is a striking proof of the fact that even when the Commanding
Officer becomes thoroughly familiar with Revolutionary institutions,
this does not serve as a guarantee of the fighting capacity
of his troops.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On July 11th Kornilov, upon his appointment to the Chief
Command of the South-Western Front, sent to the Provisional
Government his well-known telegram, of which he forwarded a
copy to the Supreme Commander-in-Chief. In that telegram,
already quoted above, Kornilov demanded the reintroduction of
capital punishment, and wrote: &ldquo;... I declare that the country
is on the verge of collapse and that, although I have not been
consulted, I <i>demand</i> that the offensive be stopped on all Fronts in
order that the Army may be saved, preserved and re-organised on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
the basis of strict discipline, and in order that the lives may not be
sacrificed of a few heroes who are entitled to see better days.&rdquo; In
spite of the peculiar wording of this appeal, the idea of stopping
the advance was immediately accepted by the Supreme Command,
the more so that the operations had practically come to a standstill
irrespective of orders as a result of the reluctance of the Russian
Army to fight and to advance, as well as of the schemes of the
German Headquarters.</p>

<p>Capital punishment and Revolutionary courts-martial were
introduced at the front. Kornilov gave an order to shoot deserters
and robbers and to expose their bodies with corresponding notices
on the roads and in other prominent places. Special shock battalions
were formed of cadets and volunteers to fight against
desertion, plunder and violence. Kornilov forbade meetings at the
Front and gave an order to stop them by the force of arms. These
measures&mdash;which were introduced by Kornilov at his own risk and
peril, his manly, straightforward utterances, and the firm tone in
which, disregarding discipline, he began to address the Provisional
Government, and last, but not least, his resolute action&mdash;considerably
enhanced his authority with the wide circles of Liberal
Democracy and with the officers. Even the Revolutionary
Democracy within the Army, stunned and depressed as it was by
the tragic turn of events, saw in Kornilov, for some time after
the <i>dÃ©bÃ¢cle</i>, the last resource and the only possible remedy in the
desperate position. It may be stated that the date of July 8th, on
which Kornilov took command of the South-Western Front and
addressed his first demand to the Provisional Government, sealed
his fate: in the eyes of many people he became a national hero and
great hopes were centred upon him&mdash;he was expected to save the
country.</p>

<p>During my stay at Minsk I was not very well informed of the
unofficial tidings prevailing in military circles, yet I felt that the
centre of moral influence had moved to Berditchev (Headquarters
of the South-Western Front). Kerensky and Brussilov had somehow
suddenly receded to the background. A new method of
administration was put into practice: we received from Kornilov&rsquo;s
Headquarters copies of his &ldquo;demands&rdquo; or notices of some strong
and striking decision he had adopted, and in a few days these were
repeated from Petrograd or from the Stavka, but in the shape of
an order or of a regulation.</p>

<p>The tragedy of July undoubtedly had a sobering effect upon the
men. In the first place, they were ashamed because things had
happened that were so shameful and so disgraceful that even the
dormant conscience and the deadened spirit of the men could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
find excuses for these happenings. Several months later, in
November, after fleeing from the captivity of Bykhov, I spent
several days under an assumed name and in civilian clothes among
the soldiers who had flooded all the railways. They were discussing
the past. I never heard a single man confessing openly
or cynically his participation in the treachery of July. They all
tried to explain away the matter and chiefly attributed it to somebody&rsquo;s
treason, especially, of course, the treason of the officers.
None spoke of his own treachery. In the second place, the men
were frightened. They felt that a kind of power, a kind of
authority had arisen, and they were quietly waiting for developments.
Lastly, operations had ended and nervous tension had
been relieved&mdash;which caused a certain reaction, apathy and
indifference. <i>This was the second occasion (the first took place
in March) on which, had the moment been immediately and properly
taken advantage of&mdash;it might have been the turning point in
the history of the Russian Revolution.</i></p>

<p>As the sounds were dying out of the last shots fired at the
Front, the men who had been stunned by the disaster began to
recover their senses. Kerensky was the first to return to sanity.
The horror had passed away, the nerve-wrecking, maddening fear
which had prompted the issue of the first stringent order.
Kerensky&rsquo;s will-power was dominated by his fear of the Soviet,
of the danger of definitely losing all prestige with the Revolutionary
Democracy by resentment against Kornilov for the resolute
tone of the latter&rsquo;s messages and by the shadow of the potential
dictator. The drafts of military regulations by which it was
intended to restore the power of the Commanding Officers and
of the Army were drowned in red tape and in the turmoil of
personal conflicts, suspicions and hatreds. The Revolutionary
Democracy once again sternly opposed the new course, as it interpreted
this course as an infringement upon the liberties and as
a menace to its own existence. The same attitude was adopted
by the Army Committees, whose powers were to be curtailed as
a first step in the proposed changes. In these circles the new
course was described as counter-revolutionary. The masses of the
soldiery, on the other hand, soon appraised the new situation.
They saw that stern words were mere words, that capital punishment
was only a bogy, because there was no real force capable
of mastering their arbitrariness. So fear vanished again. The
hurricane did not clear the close and tense atmosphere. New
clouds were overhanging and peals of a new deafening thunder
were to be heard in the distance.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXIX">CHAPTER XXIX.</a><br />
<span class="smcap">The Conference at the Stavka of Ministers and Commanders-in-Chief
on July 16th.</span></h2>

<p>Upon my return from the Front to Minsk I was summoned
to the Stavka at Moghilev, where a Conference was to be
held on July 16th. Kerensky suggested that Brussilov should invite,
of his own accord, the prominent military chiefs, in order to
discuss the actual condition of the Front, the consequences on
the July disaster, and to determine the course of future military
policy. It transpired that General Gourko, who had been invited
by Brussilov, had not been admitted to the Conference by
Kerensky. A telegram was sent to Kornilov from the Stavka
saying that, in view of the difficult position of the South-Western
Front, his attendance was impossible, and that he was requested to
present in writing his views on the questions under discussion.
It should be noted that, at that time, on July 14th and 15th, the
11th Army was in full retreat from the Sereth to the Zbrucz, and
that everyone was anxious to hear whether the 7th Army had
succeeded in crossing the Lower Sereth and the 8th the line of
Zalestchiki, thus avoiding the blows of the German Armies that
were trying to cut their retreat.</p>

<p>So sad was the plight of the country and the Army that I
decided to disclose to the Conference the full truth on the condition
of the Army in all its hideous nakedness, and in disregard of all
conventionalities. I reported myself to the Supreme Commander-in-Chief.
Brussilov surprised me. He said: &ldquo;I have come to the
conclusion that this is the limit and we must put the question
squarely. All these Commissars, Committees and Democratisations
are driving the Army and Russia to ruin. I have decided
categorically to demand that they should cease to disorganise the
Army. I hope that you will back me?&rdquo; I answered that this was
in full accord with my intentions and that the object of my visit
was to put the question squarely of the future destinies of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
Army. I must confess that Brussilov&rsquo;s words reconciled me with
him and I therefore decided to eliminate from my speech all the
bitter things which I had intended to say against the Supreme
Command.</p>

<p>We waited about an hour and a half for the Conference to meet.
We afterwards learnt that a small incident had occurred. The
Prime Minister had not been met at the station either by Brussilov
or by his Chief-of-Staff (General Lukomsky), who had been
detained by urgent military business. Kerensky waited for some
time and grew nervous. He finally sent his <i>aide-de-camp</i> to
Brussilov with the order to come to the station at once and to
report. The incident was not commented upon, but all those who
have been in touch with politics know that the actors on that stage
are mere men, with all their weaknesses, and that the game is often
continued behind the curtain.</p>

<p>The Conference was attended by the Prime Minister Kerensky,
the Foreign Minister Terestchenko, the Supreme C.-in-C. Brussilov,
his Chief-of-Staff General Lukomsky, Generals Alexeiev
and Ruzsky, the C.-in-C. of the Northern Front General Klembovsky,
by myself as C.-in-C. of the Western Front, and by my
Chief-of-Staff General Markov, Admiral Maximov, Generals
Velitchko and Romanovsky, the Commissar of the Western Front
Savinkov, and two or three young men of Kerensky&rsquo;s suite.</p>

<p>General Brussilov addressed the Conference in a short speech,
which struck me as being very vague and commonplace. In fact,
he said nothing at all. I had hoped that Brussilov would keep his
word and would sum up the situation and draw conclusions. I
was mistaken. Brussilov did not speak again. I opened the
discussion. I said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is with deep emotion and in full consciousness of a grave
responsibility that I am delivering my report to the Conference.
I beg to be excused if I speak as openly and frankly as I have
always done. I was outspoken with the old Autocracy, and intend
to be just as outspoken with the new&mdash;the Revolutionary
Autocracy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I took Command of the Front, I found the Armies in a
state of complete disruption. This seemed the more strange that
neither in the reports received at the Stavka or in those I received
upon taking over the Command had the situation been described
in such gloomy colours. The explanation is obvious: as long as
the Army Corps were not conducting active operations, excesses
were comparatively few; but no sooner was the order given for
doing the duty of a soldier, for taking up positions or for the
advance, than the instinct of self-preservation asserted itself and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
the picture of disruption was unveiled. Some ten divisions refused
to take up positions. All Commanding Officers of all grades had
to work very hard, to argue, to persuade.... In order to
be able to carry out the slightest measure of any importance, it
became imperative to reduce the numbers of mutinous troops. A
whole month was thus lost, although some divisions obeyed
orders. Disruption was rampant in the 2nd Caucasian Corps and
in the 169th Infantry Division. Several units had lost human
appearance, not only morally but physically. I shall never forget
the hour which I spent in the 703rd Suram Regiment. There were
up to ten private stills in each regiment; drunkenness, cardplaying,
rioting, plunder and even murder. I took a drastic step. I sent
the 2nd Caucasian Corps (except the 51st Infantry Division and
the 169th Infantry Division) to the rear and ordered them to be
disbanded. Before the operation had developed, I thus lost about
30,000 bayonets without firing a shot. The 28th and 29th Infantry
Divisions, which were considered the best, were sent to occupy
the sector of the Caucasians. What happened? The 29th Division,
after a forced march to its destination, returned on the next day
almost in its entirety (two and a half regiments). The 28th Division
sent one regiment to the trenches, and that regiment passed a
resolution against advancing. Every possible measure was taken
in order to raise the spirit of the troops. The Supreme Commander-in-Chief
visited the Front. From his conversations with
the members of Committee and with the men elected from two
Army Corps he gathered the impression that &lsquo;the soldiers were all
right, but the Commanding Officers had lost heart.&rsquo; That is not so.
The Commanding Officers did all they could in extremely difficult
and painful surroundings, but the Supreme Commander-in-Chief is
unaware of the fact that the meeting of the 1st Siberian Corps,
where his speech was most enthusiastically received, continued
after his departure. New speakers came forward and appealed
to the men not to listen to the &lsquo;old Bourgeois&rsquo; (forgive me, that
is so.... Brussilov interjected: &ldquo;I do not mind&rdquo;) and they
heaped vile abuse upon his head. These appeals were also enthusiastically
greeted. The War Minister, who visited the troops and
by his fiery eloquence incited them to deeds of valour, was
enthusiastically received by the 28th Division. Upon his return
to the train he was met by a regimental deputation which announced
that half an hour after the Minister had gone the regiment, as well
as another one, had decided not to advance. The picture was
particularly moving and evoked great enthusiasm when, in the
29th Division, the Commanding Officer of the Poti Infantry Regiment
knelt to receive the Red Banner. The men swore&mdash;there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
were three speakers and passionate cheering&mdash;to die for the
country. On the first day of the advance the regiment did not
reach our trenches, but turned round in a disgraceful manner and
retreated six miles behind the battlefield.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Commissars and the Committee were among the factors
which were meant to give moral support to the troops, but
practically contributed to their demoralisation. Among the Commissars
there may have been favourable exceptions of men who
did a certain amount of good without interfering with other
people&rsquo;s business. But the institution itself cannot fail to contribute
to the disruption of the Army because it implies a dual
power, friction and interference uncalled for and criminal. I am
compelled to describe the Commissars of the Western Front. One
of them, for all I know, may be a good and honest man, but he
is an Utopian and not only ignorant of Army life, but of life in
general. He has a great idea of his own importance. In demanding
that the Chief-of-Staff should obey his orders, he declares that
he is entitled to dismiss Commanding Officers, including the
General Officer commanding the Army. In explaining to the
troops the extent of his authority, he thus describes it: &lsquo;As the
fronts are subordinate to the War Minister, I am the War Minister
for the Western Front.&rsquo; Another Commissar, who knows about as
much of Army life as the first one, is a Social Democrat standing
somewhere on the verge between Bolshevism and Menchevism.
He is the noted reporter of the Military Section of the All-Russian
Congress of Soviets who has expressed the view that the Army has
not been sufficiently disorganised by the &lsquo;Declaration&rsquo; and
demanded further &lsquo;Democratisation.&rsquo; He claimed the right for
the men to veto appointments of Commanding Officers,
insisted upon part 2 of Paragraph 14 of the Declaration which
empowered the Commanding Officers to use arms against
cowards and traitors being cancelled, and upon freedom
of speech being granted not only off parade, but on
duty. The 3rd Commissar, who was not a Russian, and
who appeared to treat the Russian soldier with contempt, in
addressing the regiment used such foul language as had never
fallen from the Commanding Officers under the Czar&rsquo;s rÃ©gime.
Curiously enough the conscious and free Revolutionary warriors
accept such treatment as their due and obey him. That
Commissar, according to the Commanding Officers, is undoubtedly
useful.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Committees are another disintegrating force. I do not
deny that some of the Committees have done excellent work, and
have done their best to fulfil their duty. In particular some of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
their members have been exceedingly useful, and have rendered
their country the supreme service of dying the death of heroes.
But I affirm that the good they have done will not compensate for
the tremendous mischief done to the Army by the introduction of
all these new authorities, by friction, by interference, and by discrediting
the commands. I might quote hundreds of resolutions
bearing that stamp, but will confine myself merely to the most
blatant cases. The struggle for seizing power in the Army is
carried on openly and systematically. The Chairman of the
Committee of the Front has published in his paper an article advocating
that governmental powers be granted to the Committee.
The Army Committee of the 3rd Army has passed the resolution,
which to my intense surprise was endorsed by the Commanding
Officer, requesting &lsquo;that the Army Committees be invested with
the plenary powers of the War Minister and of the Central
Committee of the Soviets which would entitle them to act in the
name of that Committee.&rsquo; When the famous &lsquo;Declaration&rsquo; was
discussed opinions varied in the Committee of the Front in regard
to Paragraph 14. Some members wanted the second part to be
eliminated; others demanded that a proviso be added empowering
the members of the Committee of the Front to take the same
measures including armed force against the same persons, and
even against the Commanding Officers themselves. Is that not
the limit? In the report of the All-Russian Congress a demand is
formulated for the Soldiers&rsquo; Committees to be allowed to cancel
appointments of Commanding Officers, and to partake in the
administration of the Army. You must not think that this is
merely theory. Far from it. The Committees endeavour to get
hold of everything, to interfere with purely military questions, with
the routine and the administration. And this is being done in an
atmosphere of complete anarchy caused by wholesale
insubordination.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Moral preparations for the advance were proceeding apace.
On June 8th the Committee of the Front passed a resolution
against the advance, but changed its mind on the 18th. The Committee
of the 2nd Army decided against the offensive on June 1st,
but cancelled its decision on June 20th. In the Minsk Soviet 123
votes against 79 decided against the advance. All the Committees
of the 169th Infantry Division passed a vote of censure on the
Provisional Government, and described the offensive as &ldquo;treason
to the Revolution.&rdquo; The campaign against the authorities manifested
itself in a series of dismissals of Senior Commanders, in
which the Committees almost invariably participated. Shortly
before the opening of the operations an Army Corps Commander,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
the Chief-of-Staff, and a Divisional Commander of the most
important sector occupied by the shock troops, had to resign, and
the same fate was shared by about 60 Commanding Officers, from
Army Corps Commander to Regimental Commander. It is impossible
to estimate the amount of harm done by the Committee.
They have no proper discipline of their own. If the majority
passes a reasonable resolution, that does not suffice. It is put
into practice by individual members of the Committee. Taking
advantage of their position as members of Army Committees,
the Bolsheviks have more than once spread mutiny and rebellion
with impunity. As a result, authority is undermined instead of
being strengthened, because so many different individuals and
institutions are supposed to exercise that authority. And the
Commander in the Field, who is being discredited, dismissed,
controlled and watched from all sides, is nevertheless expected
to lead the troops into action with a strong hand. Such was the
moral preparation. The troops have not yet been deployed.
But the South-Western Front required immediate assistance.
The enemy had already removed from my Front to the South-West
three or four divisions. I decided to attack with the troops
which presented at least a semblance of loyalty. In three days
our guns had smashed the enemy trenches and wrought havoc
among them, had inflicted heavy losses among the Germans, and
had opened the way for our infantry. The first line had been
almost entirely broken, and our men had already visited the enemy
batteries. That breach of the Front promised to develop into a
great victory, for which we had been hoping for so long....
I now revert to descriptions of the battle. &lsquo;The units of the
28th Infantry Division took up their positions only four hours
before the attack; of the 109th Regiment only two and a half
companies, with four machine-guns and 30 officers, reached the
appointed line; only one-half of the 110th came up. Two battalions
of the 111th Regiment, who had occupied the defiles,
refused to advance; men of the 112th Regiment retired to the rear
in batches. Units of the 28th Division were met by a strong
artillery fire, machine-gun and rifle fire, and remained behind
their barbed wire, as they were incapable of advancing. Only a
few shock troops and volunteers of the Volga Regiment, with a
company of officers, succeeded in capturing the first line, but the
fire was so strong that they failed to keep the position, and
towards the afternoon units of the 29th Division returned to their
original lines after suffering heavy losses, especially in officers.
On the sector of the 51st Division the attack began at five
minutes past seven. The 202nd Gori Regiment and the 204th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
Ardagan-Michailovsky Regiment, as well as two companies of
the Sukhum Regiment, with a shock company of the Poti Regiment,
made a dash across two lines of trenches, bayoneted the
enemy, and began to storm the third line at half-past seven. The
break was so rapid and so unexpected that the enemy failed to
establish a barrage. The 201st Poti Regiment, which was following
the advance troops, approached our first line of trenches, but
refused to go any further, so that our troops who had broken
through were not reinforced in time. The units of the 134th
Division, which followed, could not carry out their orders because
the men of the Poti Regiment had crowded in the trenches, while
the enemy had opened a very strong gun fire. These units,
therefore, partly dispersed and partly lay in our trenches. Seeing
that no reinforcements were forthcoming from the rear and from
the flanks, the men of the Gori and Ardagan Regiments lost
heart, and some of the companies, in which all the officers had
been killed, began to retire. They were followed by the remainder
of the troops without, however, any pressure from the Germans,
who did not put their batteries and machine-guns into action
until the retreat had begun.... The units of the 29th Division
were late in going into position, because the men advanced
reluctantly, as their mood had changed. A quarter of an hour
before the appointed time the 114th Regiment on the right flank
refused to advance, and the Erivan Regiment had to be drawn up
from the Army Corps Reserves. For some unknown reason
the 113th and 116th Regiments also failed to move.... After
this failure desertion began to grow, and at dawn became general.
The men were tired, nervous; they had lost the habit of fighting,
and were unaccustomed to the roar of the guns owing to long
months of inactivity, of fraternisation, and of meetings. They
left the trenches <i>en masse</i>, they abandoned the machine-guns and
retired to the rear.... <i>The Headquarters of the 20th Army
Corps sent the following report of the battle: &lsquo;The cowardice
and lack of discipline in certain units reached such a pitch that
the Commanding Officers were compelled to ask our artillery to
cease firing, because the fire of our own guns caused a panic
among our soldiers.&rsquo;</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;I will quote another description of the battle made by an Army
Corps Commander who took command on the eve of battle, and
whose impressions are therefore totally unbiassed: &lsquo;...
Everything was ready for the advance: the plan had been worked
out in detail; we had a powerful and efficient artillery; the weather
was favourable because it did not allow the Germans to take
advantage of their superiority in aircraft; we had superior<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
numbers, our Reserves were drawn up in time, we had plenty of
ammunition, and the sector was well chosen for the advance,
because we were in a position to conceal strong artillery forces
in the close neighbourhood of our trenches. The undulations of
ground also afforded many hidden approaches to the Front; the
distance between ourselves and the enemy was small, and there
were no natural obstacles between us which would have had to
have been forced under fire. Finally, the troops had been
prepared by the Committees, the Commanding Officers and the
War Minister, Kerensky, and their efforts induced the troops to
take the first, the most arduous steps. We attained considerable
success without suffering appreciable losses. Three fortified
lines had been broken through and occupied, and there remained
only separate defensive positions. The fighting might soon have
reached the phase of bayonet fighting; the enemy artillery was
silenced, over 1,400 Germans, many machine-guns and other
booty had been captured. Also, our guns had inflicted heavy
casualties in killed and wounded upon the enemy, and it may be
confidently stated that the forces that were opposing our Corps
had been temporarily knocked out. Along the entire front of
our Corps only three or four enemy batteries and occasionally
three or four machine-guns were firing, and there were isolated
rifle shots. But&mdash;night came. Immediately I began to receive
anxious reports from officers commanding sectors at the Front to
the effect that the men were abandoning the unattacked Front
Line <i>en masse</i>, entire companies deserting. It was stated in some
of the reports that the firing line in places was only occupied
by the Commanding Officer, his staff, and a few men. The
operations ended in an irretrievable and hopeless failure. In one
day we had lived through the joy of victory, which had been won
in spite of the low spirits of the men, as well as the horror of
seeing the fruits of victory deliberately cast away by the soldiery.
And yet the country needed that victory for its very life. I
realised that we, the Commanding Officers, are powerless to alter
the elemental psychology of the men, and I wept long and
bitterly.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This inglorious operation, however, resulted in serious losses,
which it is now difficult to estimate, as crowds of fugitives
returned daily. Over 20,000 wounded men have already passed
through sorting stations in the rear. I will refrain at present
from drawing any conclusion, but the percentage of various kinds
of wounds is symptomatic: 10 per cent. heavily wounded, 30 per
cent. finger and wrist wounds, 40 per cent. light wounds from
which bandages were not removed at the dressing stations (many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
wounds were probably simulated), and 20 per cent. bruised and
sick. Such was the end of the operation. I have never yet gone
into battle with such superiority in numbers and technical means.
Never had the conditions been more full of such brilliant promise.
On a front of about 14 miles I had 184 battalions against 29
enemy battalions; 900 guns against 300 German: 138 of my battalions
came into action against 17 German battalions of the 1st
line. All that was wasted. Reports from various Commanders
indicate that the temper of the troops immediately after the operation
was just as indefinite as before. Three days ago I summoned
the Army Commanders and addressed to them the question:
&lsquo;Could their Armies resist a strong enemy attack, provided
reserves were forthcoming?&rsquo; The answer was in the negative.
&lsquo;Could the Armies resist an organised German offensive in their
present condition, numerical and technical?&rsquo; Two of the Army
Commanders gave indefinite replies, and the Commanding Officer
of the 10th Army answered in the affirmative. They all said:
&lsquo;We have no infantry.&rsquo; I will go further, and I will say:</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>We have no Army. It is necessary immediately, and at all
costs to create that Army.</i> The new Government regulations,
which are supposed to raise the spirit of the Army, have not yet
penetrated into its depths, and the impression they have produced
cannot yet be defined. One thing is certain&mdash;that repression alone
cannot drag the Army out of the morass into which it has fallen.
It is repeated every day that the Bolsheviks have caused the disruption
of the Army, but I disagree. It is not so. The Army
has been disrupted by others, and the Bolsheviks are like worms
which have bred in the wounds of the Army. The Army has been
disrupted by the regulations of the last four months, and it is the
bitter irony of fate that this has been done by men who, however
honest and idealistic, are unaware of the historical laws governing
the existence of the Army, of its life and routine. At first
this was done under pressure from the Soviet, which was primarily
an Anarchist institution. Later it developed into a fatal, mistaken
policy. Soon after the War Minister had taken up his duties he
said to me: &lsquo;The process of revolutionising the country and the
Army has been completed. Now we must proceed with creative
work....&rsquo; I ventured to reply: &lsquo;The process is completed,
but it is too late.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>General Brussilov here interrupted me, and asked me to
curtail my Report, as the Conference would otherwise be too
protracted. I realised that the length of the Report was not what
mattered, but it was its risky substance, and I replied: &ldquo;I consider
that this question is of paramount importance, and request<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
that I be allowed to complete my statement, otherwise I shall have
to cease speaking.&rdquo; A silence ensued, which I interpreted as a
permission to continue.</p>

<p>I then proceeded: &ldquo;The Declaration of the Soldiers&rsquo; Rights
has been issued. Every one of the Commanding Officers has stated
that it would bring about the ruin of the Army. The late Supreme
C.-in-C., General Alexeiev, telegraphed that the Declaration was
the last nail which was being driven into the coffin prepared for
the Russian Army. The present Supreme C.-in-C., when in
command of the South-Western Front, declared here, at Moghilev,
at the Conference of Commanders-in-Chief, that the Army
may yet be saved and may advance, but on one condition&mdash;if the
Declaration is not issued. Our advice, however, was unheeded.
Paragraph 3 of the Declaration authorises free and open expressions
of political, religious, social, and other views. The Army
was thus flooded by politics. When the men of the 2nd
Caucasian Grenadier Division were disbanded they were quite
sincerely puzzled. &lsquo;What is the reason? We were allowed to
speak whenever and whatever we wished, and now we are being
disbanded....&rsquo; You must not think that such a broad interpretation
of the &lsquo;Liberties&rsquo; is confined to the illiterate masses.
When the 169th Infantry Division was morally disrupted, and all
the Committees of that Division passed a vote of censure upon
the Provisional Government and categorically refused to advance,
I disbanded the Division. But there arose an unexpected complication:
the Commissars came to the conclusion that no crime had
been committed, because the spoken and the written word were
unrestricted. The only thing that could be incriminated was
direct disobedience of Army orders.... Paragraph 6 stipulates
that all literature should be delivered to the addressees, and the
Army was flooded with criminal Bolshevik and Defeatist literature.
The stuff upon which our Army was fed&mdash;and apparently
at the expense of Government funds and of the people&rsquo;s treasure&mdash;can
be gauged from the report of the Moscow Military Bureau,
which alone supplied to the Front the following publications:</p>

<p>From March 24th to May 1st&mdash;</p>

</table>

<p>and so on. The same kind of literature was sent to the villages
by the soldiers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Paragraph 14 stipulates that no soldier can be punished without
a trial. Of course, this liberty applied only to the men, because
the officers continued to suffer the heaviest penalty of dismissal.
What was the result? The Central Military Justice Administration,
without reference to the Stavka and in view of the impending
Democratisation of the Courts, suggested that the latter should
suspend their activities, except for cases of special importance,
such, for example, as treason. The Commanding Officers were
deprived of disciplinary powers. Disciplinary Courts were partly
inactive, partly were boycotted. Justice completely disappeared
from the Army. This boycott of Disciplinary Court and reports
on the reluctance of certain units to elect juries are symptomatic.
The legislator may come across the same phenomenon in respect
of the new Revolutionary Military Courts, in which juries may
also have to be replaced by appointed judges. As a result of a
series of legislative measures, authority and discipline have been
eliminated, the officers are dishonoured, distrusted, and openly
scorned. Generals in High Command, not excluding Commanders-in-Chief,
are being dismissed like domestic servants. In
one of his speeches at the Northern Front the War Minister inadvertently
uttered the following significant words: &lsquo;It lies within
my power to dismiss the entire personnel of the High Command
in twenty-four hours, and the Army would not object.&rsquo; In the
speeches addressed to the Western Front it was said that &lsquo;in
the Czarist Army we were driven into battle with whips and
machine-guns ... that Czarist Commanders led us to
slaughter, but now every drop of our blood is precious....&rsquo;
I, the Commander-in-Chief, stood by the platform erected for the
War Minister, and I was heart-broken. My conscience whispered
to me: &lsquo;That is a lie. My &ldquo;Iron&rdquo; Rifles, only eight battalions
and then twelve, took over 60,000 prisoners and 43 guns....
I have never driven them into battle with machine-guns. I have
never led my troops to slaughter at Mezolaborch, Lutovisko,
Lutsk, Chartoriisk.&rsquo; To the late Commander-in-Chief of the
South-Western Front these names are indeed familiar....</p>

<p>&ldquo;Everything may be forgiven and we can stand a great deal if it
is necessary for victory, if the troops can regain their spirit and can
be induced to advance.... I will venture to draw a comparison.
Sokolov and other Petrograd delegates came to our
front, to the 703rd Suram Regiment. He came with the noble
object of combating dark ignorance and moral decrepitude, which
were particularly apparent in that regiment. He was mercilessly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
flogged. We were, of course, revolted against that crowd of
savage scoundrels, and everyone was perturbed. All kinds of
committees passed votes of censure. The War Minister condemned
the behaviour of the Suram Regiment in fiery speeches
and Army orders, and sent a telegram of sympathy to Sokolov.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And here is another story. I well remember January, 1915,
near Lutovisko. There was a heavy frost. Colonel Noskov, the
gallant one-armed hero, up to the waist in snow, was leading his
regiment to the attack under a heavy fire against the steep and
impregnable slopes of Height 804.... Death spared him
then. And now two companies came, asked for General Noskov,
surrounded him, killed him and went away. I ask the War
Minister, did he condemn these foul murderers with the whole
might of his fiery eloquence, of his wrath and of his power, and
did he send a telegram of sympathy to the hapless family of the
fallen hero?</p>

<p>&ldquo;When we were deprived of power and authority, when the term
&lsquo;Commanding Officer&rsquo; was sterilised, we have once again been
insulted by a telegram from the Stavka to the effect that: &lsquo;Commanding
Officers who will now hesitate to apply armed force will
be dismissed and tried.&rsquo; No, gentlemen, you will not intimidate
those who are ready to lose their lives in the service of their
country.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The senior Commanding Officers may now be divided into
three categories: some of them disregarding the hardships of life
and service with a broken heart, are doing their duty devotedly to
the end; others have lost heart and are following the tide; the third
are curiously brandishing the Red Flag, and mindful of the traditions
of the Tartar captivity, are crawling before new gods of the
Revolution as they crawled before the Czars. It causes
me infinite pain to mention the question of the Officers....
It is a nightmare, and I will be brief. When Sokolov
became familiar with the Army, he said: &lsquo;I could not
imagine that your officers could be such martyrs. I take off my hat
to them.&rsquo; Yes, in the darkest days of Czarist autocracy, the police
and the gendarmerie never subjected the would-be criminal to such
moral torture and derision as the officers have to endure at present
from the illiterate masses, led by the scum of the Revolution.
Officers who are giving their lives for the country. They are
insulted at every turn. They are beaten. Yes, beaten. But they
will not come and complain to you. They are ashamed, dreadfully
ashamed. Alone, in their dug-outs, many of them are silently
weeping over their dismal fate. No wonder many officers consider
that the best solution is to be killed in action. Listen to the sub<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>dued
and placid tragedy of the following words which occur in a
Field Report: &lsquo;In vain did the officers marching in front try to
lead the men into action. At that a moment a white flag was
raised on Redoubt No. 3. Fifteen officers and a small batch of
soldiers then went forward. Their fate is unknown&mdash;they did not
return.&lsquo; (38th Corps). May these heroes rest in peace and their
blood be upon the heads of their conscious and unconscious
executioners.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Army is falling to pieces. Heroic measures are needed
for its salvation: (1) The Provisional Government should recognise
its mistakes and its guilt, as it has not understood and
estimated the noble and sincere impulse of the officers who had
greeted the news of the Revolution with joy, and had sacrificed
innumerable lives for their country. (2) Petrograd, entirely
detached from the Army, and ignorant of its life and of the
historical foundations of its existence, should cease to enact military
regulations. Full power must be given to the Supreme
Commander-in-Chief, who should be responsible only to the
Provisional Government. (3) Politics must disappear from the
Army. (4) The &lsquo;Declaration&rsquo; must be rescinded in its fundamentals.
Commissars and Committees must be abolished, and the
functions of the latter must gradually be altered. (5) Commanding
Officers must be restored to power. Discipline and the
outward form of order and good conduct must likewise be
restored. (6) Appointments to prominent posts must be made not
only according to the standard of youth and strength, but also of
experience in the field and in administration. (7) Special law-abiding
units of all arms must be placed at the disposal of Commanding
Officers as a bulwark against mutiny, and against the
horrors of possible demobilisation. (8) Military Revolutionary
Courts must be established and capital punishment introduced in
the rear for the troops and for civilians guilty of the same crimes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you ask me whether these measures are likely to produce
good results, I will answer frankly: Yes, but not at once. It is
easy to destroy the Army, but time is needed for its reconstruction.
The measures I suggest would at least lay the foundations for the
creation of a strong Army. In spite of the disruption of the Army,
we must continue the struggle, however arduous it may be, and
we must even be prepared to retreat into the depths of the country.
Our Allies should not count upon immediate relief through our
advance. Even in retreating and remaining on the defensive, we
are drawing upon us enormous enemy forces, which, were they
relieved, would be sent to the Western Front and would crush the
Allies and then turn against us. Upon this new Calvary the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
Russian people and the Russian Army may yet shed rivers of blood
and endure privations and misfortunes. But at the end of the
Calvary a bright future is in store.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is another way. The way of treason. It would give a
respite to our martyred country.... But the curse of
treachery cannot give us happiness. At the end of that path there
is political, moral and economic slavery. The destinies of the
country are in the hands of the Army. I now appeal to
the Provisional Government represented here by two Ministers:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must lead Russia towards truth and enlightenment
under the banner of Liberty, but you must give us a real chance
of leading the troops in the name of that same Liberty under our
old banners. You need have no fear. The name of the autocrat
has been removed from these banners as well as from our hearts.
It is no longer there. But there is a Mother Country; there is a
sea of blood; and there is the glory of our former victories. You
have trampled that banner into the dust. The time has now come.
Raise the banners and bow to them if your conscience is still
within you.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I had finished. Kerensky rose, shook hands with me, and said:
&ldquo;Thank you, General, for your outspoken and sincere speech.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the evidence which Kerensky subsequently gave to the
High Commission for the investigation of Kornilov&rsquo;s movement,
the Prime Minister explained this gesture by the fact that he
approved, not of the contents of my speech, but of my courage,
and that he wished to emphasise his respect for every independent
opinion, albeit entirely divergent from the views of the Provisional
Government. In substance, according to Kerensky,
&ldquo;General Deniken had for the first time drawn a plan for the
Revanche&mdash;that music of the future military reaction.&rdquo; There is
in these words a deep misinterpretation. We had not forgotten
the Galician retreat of 1915 or its causes, but, at the same time,
we could not forgive Kalush and Tarnopol in 1917. It was our
duty, our right, and our moral obligation not to wish for either
of these contingencies. I was followed by General Klembovsky.
I had left the Assembly, and only heard the end of his speech.
He described the condition of his Front in terms almost identical
to mine, with great restraint, and came to a conclusion that could
only have been prompted by deep despair: he suggested that
power should be vested at the Front in a kind of peculiar triumvirate
consisting of the Commander-in-Chief, a Commissar, and an
elected soldier....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span></p>

<p>General Alexeiev was unwell, spoke briefly, described the
condition of the rear, of the reserves and garrison troops, and
endorsed the suggestions I had made.</p>

<p>General Ruzsky, who had been undergoing a protracted cure
in the Caucasus, and was therefore out of touch with the Army,
analysed the situation such as it appeared to him from the speeches
that had been made. He quoted a series of historical comparisons
between the old Army and the new Revolutionary one with such
emphasis and bluntness that Kerensky, in replying, accused
Ruzsky of advocating the return to Czarist autocracy. The new
men were unable to understand the passionate grief of an old
soldier for the Army. Kerensky was probably unaware of the
fact that Ruzsky had been repudiated, and also passionately
accused by the Reactionary circles of the opposite crime, for the
part which he had played in the Emperor&rsquo;s abdication.</p>

<p>A telegram was read from General Kornilov, urging that
capital punishment should be introduced in the rear, chiefly in
order to cope with the licentious bands of Reservists; that disciplinary
powers should be vested in the Commanding Officers;
that the competence of the Army Committees should be
restricted and their responsibilities fixed; that meetings should be
prohibited as well as anti-national propaganda, and visits to the
Front prohibited to various delegations and agitators. All this
was practically implied in my programme, but under another
shape, and was described as &ldquo;military reaction.&rdquo; But Kornilov
had other suggestions. He advocated that Commissars should be
introduced into the Army Corps and given the right to confirm
the verdicts of the Military Revolutionary Tribunals, as well as
to effect a &ldquo;cleansing&rdquo; of the commanding staffs. This last
proposal impressed Kerensky by its &ldquo;breadth and depth of
vision&rdquo;&mdash;greater than those which emanated from the &ldquo;old
wiseacres,&rdquo; whom he considered intoxicated &ldquo;with the wine of
hate....&rdquo; There was an obvious misunderstanding, because
Kornilov&rsquo;s &ldquo;cleansing&rdquo; was not intended against the men of solid
military traditions (mistakenly identified with Monarchist Reaction),
but against the hirelings of the Revolution&mdash;unprincipled
men, deprived of will-power and of the capacity of taking the
responsibility upon their own shoulders.</p>

<p>Savinkov, the Commissar of the South-Western Front, also
spoke, expressing his own views only. He agreed with the general
description of the Front which we had given, and pointed out
that it is not the fault of the Revolutionary Democracy that the
soldiery of the old rÃ©gime is still distrustful of their Commanding
Officers; that all is not well with the latter from the military and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
political points of view, and that the main object of the new
Revolutionary institutions was to restore normal relations
between these two elements of the Army.</p>

<p>Kerensky made the closing speech of the Conference. He
tried to justify himself&mdash;spoke of the elemental character of the
inevitable &ldquo;Democratisation&rdquo; of the Army. He blamed us for
seeing in the Revolution, and in its influence upon the Russian
soldier, the only cause of the <i>dÃ©bÃ¢cle</i> of July, and he severely
condemned the old rÃ©gime. Finally, he gave us no definite
directions for future work. The members of the Conference
dispersed with a heavy feeling of mutual misunderstanding. I was
also discouraged, but at the bottom of my heart I was pleased to
think&mdash;alas! I was mistaken&mdash;that our voices had been heeded.
My hopes were confirmed by a letter from Kornilov which I
received soon after his appointment to the Supreme Command:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have read the Report you made at the Stavka on July 16th
with deep and sincere satisfaction. I would sign such a Report
with both hands; I take off my hat to you, and I am lost in admiration
before your firmness and courage. I firmly believe that, with
the help of the Almighty, we will succeed in accomplishing the
task of reconstructing our beloved Army and of restoring its
fighting power.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fate has, indeed, cruelly derided our hopes!</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXX" id="CHAPTER_XXX">CHAPTER XXX.</a><br />
<span class="smcap">General Kornilov.</span></h2>

<p>Two days after the Moghilev Conference General Brussilov
was relieved of the Supreme Command. The attempt to give
the leadership of the Russian Armies to a person who had not only
given proof of the most complete loyalty to the Provisional
Government, but had evinced sympathy with its reforms, had
failed. A leader had been superseded, who, on assuming the
Supreme Command, gave utterance to the following:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am the leader of the Revolutionary Army, appointed to this
responsible post by the people in revolution and the Provisional
Government, in agreement with the Petrograd Soviet of Workmen&rsquo;s
and Soldiers&rsquo; Delegates. I was the first to go over to the
people, serve the people. I will continue to serve them, will never
desert them.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>Kerensky, in his evidence before the Commission of Inquiry,
explained Brussilov&rsquo;s dismissal by the catastrophal condition of the
Front, by the possible development of the German offensive, the
absence of a firm hand at the front, and of a definite plan; by
Brussilov&rsquo;s inability to evaluate and forestall the complications of
the military situation, and lastly, by his lack of influence over both
officers and men.</p>

<p>Be it as it may, General Brussilov&rsquo;s retirement from the pages
of military history can in no wise be regarded as a simple episode
of an administrative character. <i>It marks a clear recognition by the
Government of the wreck of its entire military policy.</i></p>

<p>On July 19th, by an Order of the Provisional Government, Lavr
Georgievich Kornilov, General of Infantry, was appointed to the
post of Supreme Commander-in-Chief.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<p>In Chapter VII. I spoke of my meeting with Kornilov, then
Commander-in-Chief of the Petrograd district. The whole
meaning of his occupation of this post lay in the chance of bringing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
the Petrograd garrison to a sense of duty and subordination. This
Kornilov failed to accomplish. A fighting General who carried
fighting men with him by his courage, coolness, and contempt of
death, had nothing in common with that mob of idlers and
hucksters into which the Petrograd garrison had been transformed.
His sombre figure, his dry speech, only at times softened by sincere
feeling, and above all, its tenour so far removed from the bewil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>dering
slogans of the Revolution, so simple in its profession of a
soldier&rsquo;s faith&mdash;could neither fire nor inspire the Petrograd soldiery.
Inexperienced in political chicanery, by profession alien
to those methods of political warfare which had been developed by
the joint efforts of the bureaucracy, party sectarianism, and the
revolutionary underworld, Kornilov, as Commander-in-Chief of
the Petrograd district, could neither influence the Government nor
impress the Soviet, which, without any cause, distrusted him from
the very beginning. Kornilov would have managed to suppress
the Petrograd praetorians, even if he had perished in doing so, but
he could not attract them to himself.</p>

<p>He felt that the Petrograd atmosphere did not suit him, and
when on April 21st, the Executive Committee of the Soviet, after
the first Bolshevist attacks, passed a resolution that no military
unit could leave barracks in arms without the permission of the
Committee, it was totally impossible for Kornilov to remain at a
post which gave no rights and imposed enormous responsibilities.</p>

<p>There was yet another reason: the Commander-in-Chief of the
Petrograd district was subordinated, not to the Stavka, but to the
Minister of War. Gutchkov had left that post on April 30th, and
Kornilov did not wish to remain under Kerensky, the vice-president
of the Petrograd Soviet.</p>

<p>The position of the Petrograd garrison and command was so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
incongruous that this painful problem had to be solved by artificial
measures. On Kornilov&rsquo;s initiative, and with General Alexeiev&rsquo;s
full approval, the Stavka, in conjunction with the Headquarters
of the Petrograd District, drew up a scheme for the organisation
of the Petrograd Front, covering the approaches to the capital
through Finland and the Finnish Gulf. This Front was to include
the troops in Finland and Kronstadt, on the coast, of the Reval
fortified region and the Petrograd garrison, the depÃ´t battalions of
which it was proposed to expand into active regiments and form
into brigades; the inclusion of the Baltic Fleet was likewise probable.
Such an organisation&mdash;logical from a strategical point of
view, especially in connection with the information received of the
reinforcement of the German Front on the line of advance on
Petrograd&mdash;gave the Commander-in-Chief the legal right to alter
the dispositions to relieve the troops at the front and behind, etc.
I do not know whether this would have really made it possible to
free Petrograd from the garrison which had become a veritable
scourge to the Capital, the Provisional Government, and even (in
September) to the non-Bolshevist sections of the Soviet. The
Government most thoughtlessly bound itself by a promise, given
in its first declaration, that &ldquo;the troops which had taken part in the
revolutionary movement should not be either disarmed or moved
from Petrograd.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This plan, however, naturally failed on Kornilov&rsquo;s departure,
as his successors, appointed one after another by Kerensky, were
of such an indefinite political character, and so deficient in military
experience, that it was impossible to place them at the head of so
large a military force.</p>

<p>At the end of April, just before his retirement, Gutchkov
wished to make Kornilov Commander-in-Chief of the Northern
Front, a post which had become vacant after General Ruzsky&rsquo;s
dismissal. General Alexeiev and I were at the Conference with
Thomas and the French military representatives, when I was called
up to the telegraph instrument to talk with the Minister of War.
As General Alexeiev remained at the meeting, and Gutchkov was
ill in bed, the negotiations, in which I acted as an intermediary,
were exceedingly difficult to carry on, both technically and because,
in view of the indirect transmission, it was necessary to speak
somewhat guardedly. Gutchkov insisted, Alexeiev refused. No
less than six times did I transmit their replies, which were at first
reserved and then more heated.</p>

<p>Gutchkov spoke of the difficulty of managing the Northern
Front, which was the most unruly, and of the need of a firm hand
there. He said that it was desirable to retain Kornilov in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
immediate vicinity of Petrograd, in view of future political possibilities.
Alexeiev refused flatly. He said nothing about &ldquo;political
possibilities,&rdquo; basing his refusal on the grounds of Kornilov&rsquo;s
inadequate service qualifications for command, and the awkwardness
of passing over Senior Commanders more experienced and
acquainted with the Front, such as General Abram Dragomirov,
for instance. Nevertheless, when the next day an official telegram
arrived from the Ministry in connection with Kornilov&rsquo;s
appointment, Alexeiev replied that he was uncompromisingly
against it, and that if the appointment were made in spite of this,
he would immediately send in his resignation.</p>

<p>Never had the Supreme Commander-in-Chief been so inflexible
in his communications with Petrograd. Some persons, including
Kornilov himself (as he confessed to me afterwards), involuntarily
gained the impression that the question was a somewhat
wider basis one than that of the appointment of the Commander-in-Chief
... that the fear of a future dictator played a
certain part. However, this supposition is flatly contradicted by
placing this episode in conjunction with the fact that the Petrograd
Front was created for Kornilov&mdash;a fact that was of no less
importance and fraught with possibilities.</p>

<p>In the beginning of May Kornilov took over the 8th Army on
the South-Western Front. General Dragomirov was appointed
Commander-in-Chief of the Northern Front.</p>

<p>This is the second event which gives the key to the understanding
of the subsequent relations between Alexeiev and Kornilov.</p>

<p>According to Kornilov, the 8th Army was in a state of complete
disintegration when he assumed command. &ldquo;For two
months,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;I had to visit the units nearly every day and
personally explain to the soldiers the necessity for discipline,
encourage the officers, and urge upon the troops the necessity
of an advance.... Here I became convinced that firm language
from the Commander and definite action were necessary
in order to arrest the disintegration of our Army. I understood
that such language was expected both by the officers and the men,
the more reasonable of whom were already tired of the complete
anarchy....&rdquo;</p>

<p>Under what conditions Kornilov made his rounds we have
already shown in <a href="#CHAPTER_XXIII">Chapter XXIII</a>. I hardly think that he managed
to arouse the mass of soldiers to consciousness. The Kalush of
June 28th and the Kalush of July 8th show the 8th Army equally
as heroes and as beasts. The officers and a small part of the real
soldiers, however, were more than ever under the spell of
Kornilov&rsquo;s personality. Its power increased among the non-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>Socialistic
sections of the Russian public likewise. When, after
the rout of July 6th, General Gutor&mdash;who had been appointed to
the highly responsible post of Commander-in-Chief of the South-Western
Front, merely not to resist the democratisation of the
Army&mdash;yielded to despair and collapsed, there was no one to
replace him except Kornilov (on the night of July 8th)....
The spectre of the &ldquo;General on a White Horse&rdquo; was already looming
in sight and disturbing the spiritual peace of many.</p>

<p>Brussilov was strongly opposed to this appointment. Kerensky
hesitated for a moment. The position, however, was catastrophical.
Kornilov was bold, courageous, stern, resolute and
independent, and would never hesitate to show initiative or to
undertake any responsibility if circumstances required it.
Kerensky was of the opinion<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> that Kornilov&rsquo;s downright qualities,
though dangerous in case of success, would be only too useful in
case of a panic-stricken retreat. And &ldquo;when the Moor has done
his work, let the Moor go....&rdquo; So Kerensky insisted on
Kornilov&rsquo;s appointment as Commander-in-Chief of the South-Western
Front.</p>

<p>On the third day after taking over his duties, Kornilov wired
to the Provisional Government: &ldquo;I declare that if the Government
does not confirm the measures proposed by me, and deprives
me of the only means of saving the Army and of using it for its
real purpose of defending the Motherland and liberty, then I,
General Kornilov, will of my own accord lay down my authority
as Commander-in-Chief....&rdquo;</p>

<p>A series of political telegrams from Kornilov produced a profound
impression on the country, and inspired some with fear,
some with hate, and others with hope. Kerensky hesitated, but
what about the support of the Commissars and Committees? The
tranquilisation and reduction to order of the South-Western Front
attained, among other means, by Kornilov&rsquo;s bold, resolute
struggle against the Army Bolsheviks? The oppressive isolation
felt by the Minister of War after the conference of July 16th? The
uselessness of retaining Brussilov as Supreme Commander-in-Chief
and the hopelessness of placing at the head of the Army
Generals of the new type, as shown by the experiment of appointing
Brussilov and Gutor? Savinkov&rsquo;s persistent advice? Such
were the reasons which forced Kerensky&mdash;who fully recognised
the inevitability of the coming collision with the man who repudiated
his military policy with every fibre of his soul&mdash;to decide on
the appointment of Kornilov to the post of Supreme Commander-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>in-Chief.
There is not the slightest doubt that Kerensky did this
in a fit of despair. Probably it was the same feeling of fatality
that induced him to appoint Savinkov acting Minister of War.</p>

<p>The collisions occurred sooner than might have been expected.
On receiving the order for his appointment, Kornilov at once sent
the Provisional Government a telegram &ldquo;reporting&rdquo; that he
could accept command and &ldquo;lead the nation to victory and to the
prospect of a just and honourable peace only on the following
conditions:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&ldquo;(1) Responsibility to his own conscience and to the whole
nation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;(2) Complete non-interference with his orders relating to
military operations and, therefore, with the appointment of the
Higher Command.</p>

<p>&ldquo;(3) The application of the measures recently introduced at
the Front to all places in the rear where drafts for the Army
were quartered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;(4) Acceptance of his proposals telegraphed to the Conference
at the Stavka on July 16th.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>When in due course I read this telegram in the newspapers,
I was not a little surprised at the first condition, which established
a highly original form of suzerainty on the part of the Supreme
Command until the convocation of the Constituent Assembly. I
waited impatiently for the official reply. There was none. As it
turned out, on receiving Kornilov&rsquo;s ultimatum, the Council of the
Government hotly debated the matter, and Kerensky demanded
that the prestige of the High Command should be upheld by the
immediate removal of the new Supreme Commander-in-Chief.
The Government did not agree to this, and Kerensky, ignoring
the other points mentioned in the telegram, replied only to the
second, by recognising the right of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief
to select his own direct assistants.</p>

<p>Diverging from the established procedure of appointments,
the Government, simultaneously with Kornilov&rsquo;s appointment
and without his knowledge, issued an order appointing General
Cheremissov Commander-in-Chief of the South-Western Front.
Kornilov regarded this as a complete violation of his rights, and
sent another ultimatum, declaring that he could continue to hold
Supreme Command only on condition of Cheremissov&rsquo;s immediate
removal. He declined to go to Moghilev before this question
was settled. Cheremissov, on his part, was very &ldquo;nervy,&rdquo; and
threatened to &ldquo;bomb his way&rdquo; into Front Headquarters and to
establish his rights as Commander-in-Chief.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span></p>

<p>This complicated matters still further, and Kornilov reported
by wire<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> to Petrograd that, in his opinion, it would be more
regular to dismiss Cheremissov. &ldquo;For the purpose of strengthening
discipline in the Army, we decided to take severe measures
with the soldiers; the same measures must likewise apply to the
higher military commanders.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Revolution had upset all mutual relations and the very
essence of discipline. As a soldier, I was bound to see in all this
the undermining of the authority of the Provisional Government
(if such existed), and I could not but recognise that it was both
the right and the duty of the Government to make everyone respect
its authority.</p>

<p>As a chronicler, however, I must add that the military leaders
had no other means of stopping this disintegration of the Army,
proceeding from above. And had the Government actually
possessed the power, and in full panoply of right and might had
been able to assert itself, there would have been no ultimatums
either from the Soviet or from the military leaders. Furthermore,
there would have been no need for the events of the 27th of
August, and those of the 25th of October would have been
impossible.</p>

<p>The matter finally resolved itself into the arrival of Commissar
Filonenko at Front Headquarters. He informed Kornilov that
all his recommendations had been accepted by the Government,
in principle, while Cheremissov was placed at the disposal of the
Provisional Government. General Balnev was hastily, at random,
selected to command the South-Western Front, and Kornilov
assumed the Supreme Command on the 27th of July.</p>

<p>The spectre of the &ldquo;General on the White Horse&rdquo; became
more and more clearly visible. And the eyes of many, suffering
at the sight of the madness and the shame now engulfing
Russia, were again and again turned to this spectre. Honest
and dishonest, sincere and insincere, politicians, soldiers and
adventurers, all turned to it. And all with one voice cried out,
&ldquo;Save Us!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He, the stern and straightforward soldier, deeply patriotic,
untried in politics, knowing little of men, hypnotised both by truth
and flattery, and by the general longing expectation of someone&rsquo;s
coming, moved by a fervent desire for deeds of sacrifice&mdash;he truly
believed in the predestined nature of his appointment. He lived
and fought with this belief, and died for it on the banks of the
Kuban.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span></p>

<p>Kornilov became a sign and rallying point. To some, of
counter-Revolution; to others, of the salvation of their native land.</p>

<p>Around this point a struggle for influence and power was commenced
by people who, unaided, without him could not have
attained to such power.</p>

<p>A characteristic episode had already taken place on the 8th of
July, at Kamenetz-Podolsk. Here, in Kornilov&rsquo;s entourage,
there occurred the first conflict between Savinkov and Zavoiko,
the former being the most prominent Russian Revolutionary,
leader of the Terrorist fighting group of the Social-Revolutionary
Party, organiser of the most notorious political assassinations&mdash;those
of Plehve, Minister of the Interior, of the Grand Duke
Serge, etc. Strong-willed and cruel by nature, completely lacking
in the controlling influences of &ldquo;conventional morality,&rdquo;
despising both the Provisional Government and Kerensky, supporting
the Provisional Government from motives of expediency,
as he understood it, ready at any moment to sweep them aside&mdash;he
saw in Kornilov merely a weapon in the fight for Revolutionary
power, in which <i>he</i> must have a dominant interest. Zavoiko was
one of those peculiar personages who afterwards clustered closely
round Kornilov and played such a prominent part in the August
days. He was not very well known even to Kornilov. The
latter stated, in his evidence before the Supreme Commission of
Inquiry, that he became acquainted with Zavoiko in April, 1917;
that Zavoiko had been &ldquo;marechal de noblesse&rdquo; of the Haisin
district of Podolia, had been employed on the Nobel oilfields in
Baku, and, by his own statements, had been employed in prospecting
for minerals in Turkestan and Western Siberia. He arrived
in Czernowitz, enrolled as a volunteer in the Daghestan Mounted
Regiment, and was retained at Army Headquarters as personal
aide to Kornilov. That is all that is known of Zavoiko&rsquo;s past.</p>

<p>Kornilov&rsquo;s first telegram to the Provisional Government was
edited by Zavoiko, who &ldquo;gave it the form of an ultimatum with
a concealed threat, in case of non-compliance with the demands
presented to the Provisional Government, to proclaim a military
dictatorship on the South-Western Front.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>I discovered all this subsequently. During all these events I
continued working at Minsk, completely engrossed now, not by
the offensive, but by the organisation of any sort of skeleton
defence of the half-collapsed Front. There was no information,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
no rumours even, of what was going on at the head of affairs.
Only an increased tension was noticeable in all official relations.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Quite unexpectedly, in the end of July the Stavka offered me
the post of Commander-in-Chief of the South-Western Front. I
communicated by wire with General Lukomsky, the Chief-of-Staff
of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief, and told him that I should
obey orders and go wherever I was sent, but would like to know
the reason for this exchange. If the reasons were political I
should ask to be left at my old post. Lukomsky assured me that
what Kornilov had in view was only the military importance of
the South-Western Front and the proposed strategical operations
in that quarter. I accepted the post.</p>

<p>I parted from my assistants with regret, and, having transferred
my friend, General Markov, to the new front, left for my
new place of service together with him. On my way I stopped
at Moghilev. The Stavka was in a very optimistic mood; everyone
was animated and hopeful, but there were no signs of any
&ldquo;underground&rdquo; conspiratory working. It should be mentioned
that in this respect the military were so naÃ¯vely inexperienced,
that when they really began to &ldquo;conspire&rdquo; their work took such
<i>obvious</i> forms that the deaf could not help hearing, nor the blind
seeing, what was going on.</p>

<p>On the day of our arrival Kornilov held a Council of the
Chiefs of Departments of the Stavka, at which the so-called
&ldquo;Kornilov programme&rdquo; for the restoration of the Army was
discussed. I was invited to attend. I shall not repeat all the
fundamental propositions, which have already been mentioned
both by me and in Kornilov&rsquo;s telegrams&mdash;such demands, for
instance, as the introduction of Revolutionary courts-martial and
capital punishment in the rear, the restoration of disciplinary
authority to Commanders and raising their prestige, the limitation
of the activity of the Committees and their responsibility, etc. I
remember that side by side with clear and irrefutable propositions&mdash;the
draft memorandum drawn up by the Departments of the
Stavka&mdash;there were bureaucratic lucubrations hardly applicable in
actual life. For instance, with the object of making disciplinary
authority more palatable to Revolutionary Democracy, the
authors of the memorandum had drawn up a curiously detailed
list of disciplinary misdemeanour with a corresponding scale of
penalties. And this was meant for the seething whirlpool of life,
where all relations were trampled underfoot, all standards vio<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>lated,
where every fresh day brought forward an endless variety
of departures from the regulations!</p>

<p>At any rate, the Supreme Command was finding the proper
path, and apparently Kornilov&rsquo;s personality was a guarantee
that the Government would be obliged to follow that path.
Undoubtedly a long struggle with the Soviets, Committees, and
soldiery was still to be waged, but, at least, the definiteness of
the policy gave moral support and a tangible basis for this heavy
task in the future. On the other hand, the support given to
Kornilov&rsquo;s measures by Savinkov&rsquo;s War Ministry gave reason to
hope that Kerensky&rsquo;s vacillations and indecision would finally be
overcome. The attitude to this question of the Provisional
Government as a whole was of no practical importance, and could
not even be officially expressed. At that time it seemed as if
Kerensky had, in some degree, freed himself from the yoke of
the Soviet, but, just as formerly all the most important questions
of State had been settled by him apart from the Government, in
conjunction with the leading Soviet circles, now, in August, the
direction of State affairs passed into the hands of a triumvirate
composed of Kerensky, Nekrassov, and Tereschenko, leaving
both the Socialist and Liberal groups of the Government out of
the running.</p>

<p>After the meeting was over Kornilov asked me to stay, and,
when all had left, said to me, almost in a whisper: &ldquo;It is necessary
to struggle, otherwise the country will perish. N. came to
see me at the Front. He is nursing his scheme of a <i>coup d&rsquo;Ã©tat</i>
and of placing the Grand-Duke Dmitri on the throne. He is
organising something or other, and has suggested collaboration.
I told him flatly that I would take no part in any Romanov adventures.
The Government itself understands that it can do nothing.
They have offered my joining in the Government.... No,
thank you! These gentlemen are far too much entangled with
the Soviets, and cannot decide on anything. I have told them
that if authority is given me I shall carry on a decisive struggle.
We must lead Russia to a Constituent Assembly, and then let
them do what they like. I shall stand aside and not interfere in
any way. Now, General, may I rely on your support?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To the fullest extent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was my second meeting and my second conversation with
Kornilov. We embraced heartily and parted ... only to
meet again in the Bykhov Prison.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXI" id="CHAPTER_XXXI">CHAPTER XXXI.</a></h2>

<p class="chapsummary"><span class="smcap">My Service as Commander-in-Chief of the South-Western
Front&mdash;The Moscow Conference&mdash;The Fall of Riga.</span></p>

<p>I was touched by General Alexeiev&rsquo;s letter:</p>

<p>&ldquo;My thoughts are with you in your new appointment. I
consider that you have been sent to perform a superhuman task.
Much has been said, but apparently little has been done there.
Nothing has been done even after the 16th July by Russia&rsquo;s chief
babbler.... The authority of the Commanders is being
steadily curtailed. Should you want my help in anything I am
ready to go to Berdichev, to go to the Front, to one Command
or another.... God preserve you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here was a man, indeed, whom neither an exalted position
nor misfortunes could change. He was full of his modest, disinterested
work for the good of his native land.</p>

<p>A new front, new men. The South-Western Front, shaken by
the events in July, was gradually recovering. Not, however, in
the sense of real convalescence, as the optimists thought, but of a
return approximately to its condition prior to the offensive. There
were the same strained relations between officers and men, the same
slip-shod service, the desertion, and open unwillingness to fight,
which was only less actively expressed owing to the lull in operations;
finally there was the same Bolshevist propaganda, only more
active, and not infrequently disguised under the form of Committee
&ldquo;fractions&rdquo; and preparations for the Constituent Assembly. I
have a document referring to the 2nd Army of the Western Front.
It is highly characteristic as an indication of the unparalleled toleration
and, indeed, encouragement of the disintegration of the Army
on the part of the representatives of the Government and Commanders,
under the guise of liberty and conscious voting at the
elections. Here is a copy of the telegram sent to all the senior
officers of the 2nd Army:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The Army Commander, in agreement with the Commissar, and at the
request of the Army fraction of the Bolshevist Social-Democrats, has permitted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
the organisation, from the 15th to 18th October, of preparatory courses for
instructors of the aforesaid fraction for the elections to the Constituent
Assembly, one representative of the Bolshevist organisation of each separate
unit being sent to the said courses. No. 1644.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Suvorov.</span><a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>The same toleration had been exercised in many cases
previously, and was founded on the exact meaning of the regulations
for Army Committees and of the &ldquo;Declaration of Soldiers&rsquo;
Rights.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Carried away by the struggle against counter-revolution, the
Revolutionary institutions had paid no attention to such facts as
public meetings with extreme Bolshevist watchwords being held at
the very place where the Front Headquarters were situated, or that
the local paper, <i>Svobodnaia Mysl</i>,<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> most undisguisedly threatened
the officers with a St. Bartholomew&rsquo;s Eve.</p>

<p>The front was <i>holding out</i>. That is all that could be said of the
situation. At times there would be disturbances ending tragically,
such as the brutal murder of Generals Girshfeld, Hirschfeld, and
Stefanovich, Commissar Linde. The preliminary arrangements
and the concentration of the troops for the coming partial offensive
were made, but there was no possibility of launching the actual
attack until the &ldquo;Kornilov programme&rdquo; had been put into practice
and the results known.</p>

<p>I waited very impatiently.</p>

<p>The Revolutionary organisations (the Commissariat and Committee)
of the South-Western Front were in a position; they had
not yet seized power, but some of it had already been yielded to
them voluntarily by a series of Commanders-in-Chief&mdash;Brussilov,
Gutor, Baluev. Therefore, my coming at once roused their
antagonism. The Committee of the Western Front lost no time in
sending a scathing report on me to Berdichev on the basis of which
the next issue of the Committee&rsquo;s organ published an impressive
warning to the &ldquo;enemies of democracy.&rdquo; As usual, I totally
omitted to invoke the aid of the Commissariat, and sent a message
to the Committee saying that I could have nothing to do with it
unless it kept rigidly within the limits of the law.</p>

<p>The Commissar of the Front was a certain Gobechio. I saw
him once only, on my arrival. In a few days he got transferred to
the Caucasus, and his post was taken by Iordansky.<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> As soon as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
he arrived he issued an &ldquo;order to the troops at the Front.&rdquo; Afterwards
he was unable to understand that two persons could not
command the Front at one and the same time. Iordansky and his
assistants, Kostitsin and Grigorier&mdash;a literary man, zoologist, and
doctor respectively&mdash;were probably rather prominent men in their
own profession, but utterly ignorant of military life.</p>

<p>The Committee of the Front was no better and no worse than
others.<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> It took the &ldquo;Defencist&rdquo; point of view, and even
supported the repressive measures taken by Kornilov in July, but
at that time the Committee was not in the least degree a <i>military</i>
institution organically connected&mdash;for good or evil&mdash;with the true
Army life. It was merely a mixed party organ. Divided into
&ldquo;fractions&rdquo; of all the Socialist parties, the Committee positively
revelled in politics, and introduced them at the Front likewise. The
Committee carried on propaganda on a large scale, convened congresses
of representatives in order to have them converted by
Socialist fractions, including such as were openly antagonistic to
the policy of the Government. I made an attempt to stop this
work in view of the impending strategical operations and the difficult
period of transition, but met with determined opposition on the
part of Commissar Iordansky. At the same time, the Committee
was perpetually interfering in all questions of military authority,
spreading sedition and distrust to the commanders.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Meanwhile, both in Petrograd and Moghilev, events were taking
their course, and we could grasp their meaning only in so far as
they were reflected by newspaper reports, rumours and gossip.</p>

<p>There was still no &ldquo;programme.&rdquo; The Moscow State Conference<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>
raised great hopes, but it met without making any
changes in either State or military policy. On the contrary, it even
outwardly emphasises the irreconcilable enmity between the Revolutionary
Democracy and the Liberal Bourgeoisie, between the
Commanders and the soldiers&rsquo; representatives.</p>

<p>If the Moscow Conference yielded no positive results, nevertheless,
it fully exposed the mood of the opponents, the leaders and
the rulers. All unanimously recognised that the country was in
deadly peril. Everyone understood that the social relations had
suffered an upheaval, that all branches of the nation&rsquo;s economy had
been uprooted. Each party reproached the other with supporting
the selfish interests of their class. This, however, was not the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
important matter, for, strange as it may seem, the primary causes
of social class war, even the agrarian and labour questions, merely
led to disagreement, without rousing any irreconcilable dissentions.
Even when Plekhanov, the old leader of the Social-Democrats,
amid universal approval, turned to the Right
demanding sacrifice, and to the Left demanding moderation, it
seemed as if the chasm between the two opposing social camps
was not so very great.</p>

<p>All the attention of the Conference was taken up by other
questions, those of <i>authority and of the Army</i>.</p>

<p>Miliukov enumerated all the sins of the Government, vanquished
by the Soviets, its &ldquo;capitulation&rdquo; to the ideology of the
Socialist parties and Zimmerwaldists, capitulation in the Army, in
foreign policy, to the Utopian demands of the working classes, to
the extreme demands of nationalities.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The usurpation of the authority of the State by Central and
Local Committees and Soviets,&rdquo; said General Kaledin distinctly,
&ldquo;must be stopped at once and decisively.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Maklakov smoothed the way for his attack: &ldquo;I demand
nothing, but I cannot help drawing attention to the alarm felt by
the social conscience when it sees that the &lsquo;Defeatists&rsquo; of yesterday
have been invited to join the Government.&rdquo; Shulgin (Right)
is agitated. He says: &ldquo;I want your (the Provisional Government&rsquo;s)
authority to be really strong, really unlimited. I want
this, though I know that a strong Government easily turns to
despotism, which is more likely to crush me than you, the friends
of that Government.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the Left, Jehkheidze sings the praises of the Soviets: &ldquo;It
is only owing to the Revolutionary organisations that the creative
spirit of the Revolution has been preserved, for the salvation of
the country from the disintegration of authority and from
anarchy....&rdquo; &ldquo;There is no power higher than that of the
Provisional Governments,&rdquo; says Tzeretelli, &ldquo;because the source
of this power the sovereign people has, through all the organs
at its disposal, directly delegated this power to the Provisional
Government.&rdquo; Of course, in so far as that Government submits
to the will of the Soviets?... And over all one hears the
dominating voice of the President of the Congress, who is seeking
for &ldquo;heavenly words&rdquo; in order to &ldquo;express his shuddering
horror&rdquo; at coming events, &ldquo;and at the same time brandishing a
wooden sword and threatening his hidden enemies thus: &lsquo;Be it
known to everyone who has once tried to offer armed resistance
to the authority of the people that the attempt will be smothered
in blood and iron. Let those beware who think that the time has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
come for them to overthrow the Revolutionary Government with
the help of bayonets.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The contradiction was still more striking in military matters.
In a dry but powerful speech, the Supreme Commander-in-Chief
drew a picture of the destruction of the Army, involving the whole
country in its ruin, and with great reserve explained the gist of
his programme. General Alexeiev related, with genuine bitterness,
the sad story of the sins, sufferings and gallantry of the
former Army.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Weak in technical resources and morally strong in spirit and
discipline,&rdquo; he related how the Army had lived to see the bright
days of the Revolution, and how later on, &ldquo;when it was thought
to be a danger to the conquests of the Revolution, it was inoculated
with deadly poison.&rdquo; Kaledin, the Don Cossack Attaman, representing
thirteen Cossack Armies and unhampered by any
official position, spoke sharply and distinctly: &ldquo;The Army must
keep out of politics. There must be no political meetings with
their party struggles and disputes. All the (Army) Soviets and
Committees must be abolished. The Declaration of Soldiers&rsquo;
Rights must be revised. Discipline must be raised both at the
Front and in the rear. The disciplinary authority of the Commanders
must be restored. All power to the leaders of the
Army!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kuchin, the representative of the Army and Front Committees,
rose to reply to these trite military axioms. &ldquo;The Committees
were a manifestation of the instinct of self-defence.... They
had to be formed as organs for the protection of the privates, as
hitherto there had been nothing but oppression ... the Committees
had brought light and knowledge to the soldiers....
Then came the second period&mdash;one of decay and disorganisation
... &lsquo;rearguard consciousness&rsquo; made its appearance, but
failed to digest all the mass of questions which the Revolutions
had raised in the minds of the soldiery....&rdquo; Now the
speaker did not deny the necessity for repressive measures, but
they &ldquo;must be compatible with the definite work of Army organisations....&rdquo;
How this was to be done had been shown by
the united front of Revolutionary Democracy, namely, the Army
must be animated, not by the desire of victory over the enemy,
but by &ldquo;a repudiation of Imperialistic aims, and a desire for the
speedy attainment of universal peace on Democratic principles....
The commanders should possess complete independence
in the conduct of military operations, and have a decisive voice in
questions of discipline and service training.&rdquo; The object of the
organisations, on the other hand, was to introduce their policy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
wholesale among troops, and &ldquo;the Commissars must be the
introducers of (this) single Revolutionary policy of the Provisional
Government, the Army Committees must direct the social
and political life of the soldiers. The restoration of the disciplinary
authority of the commanders is not to be thought of,&rdquo;
etc.</p>

<p>What is the Government going to do? Will it find enough
strength and boldness to burst the fetters placed on it by the
Bolshevistic Soviet?<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>Kornilov said firmly, repeating his words twice: &ldquo;I do not
doubt for a moment that the (my) measures will be carried out
without delay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And if not&mdash;was it to be War?</p>

<p>He also said: &ldquo;It is impossible to admit that the determination
to carry out these measures should in every case be aroused
merely by the pressure of defeats and loss of territory. If the
rout at Tarnopol and the loss of Galicia and Bukovina did indeed
result in restoration of discipline at the Front, it cannot be admitted
that order in the rear should be restored at the cost of the loss of
Riga, and that order on the railways should be restored by the
cession of Moldavia and Bessarabia to the enemy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the 20th Riga fell.</p>

<p>Both strategically and tactically the Front of the lower Dvina
was in complete preparedness. Taking into consideration the
strength of the defensive positions, the forces were also sufficient.
The officers in command were General Parsky, Army Commander,
and General Boldyrev, Corps Commander; both experienced
Generals, and certainly not inclined to counter-Revolution in the
opinion of the Democrats.<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>Finally, from deserters&rsquo; reports, our Headquarters knew not
only the direction but even the day and the hour of the contemplated
attack.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, on the 19th August the Germans (Von Hutier&rsquo;s
8th Army), after heavy artillery preparation, occupied the UxkÃ¼ll
bridgehead in the face of feeble opposition on our part, and
crossed the Dvina. On 20th August the Germans assumed the
offensive also along the Mitau road; towards evening of the same
day the enemy&rsquo;s UxkÃ¼ll group, having pierced our lines on the
Egel, began deploying in a northerly direction, threatening the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
retreat of the Russian troops towards Wenden. The 12th Army,
abandoning Riga, retired some 60-70 versts, losing touch with
the enemy, and on the 25th occupied the so-called Wenden position.
The Army lost in prisoners alone some 9,000 men, besides
81 guns, 200 machine-guns, etc. A further advance did not enter
into the German plans, and they commenced to establish themselves
on the extensive terrain of the right bank of the Dvina,
immediately sending off two divisions to the Western Front.</p>

<p>We lost the rich industrial town of Riga, with all its military
structures and supplies; more important still, we lost a safe defensive
line, the abandonment of which placed both the Dvina Front
and the way to Petrograd under a constant threat.</p>

<p>The fall of Riga made a great impression in the country.
Quite unexpectedly, however, it called forth from the Revolutionary
Democracy, not repentance, not patriotic fervour, but,
instead, a still greater bitterness towards the leaders and officers.
The Stavka in one <i>communiquÃ©</i><a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> inserted the following sentence:
&ldquo;The disorganised masses of the soldiery are flocking in
uncontrollable masses along the Pskov high road and the road to
Bieder-Limburg.&rdquo; This statement, undoubtedly true, and neither
mentioning nor relating to the causes of the above, raised a storm
amongst the Revolutionary Democracy. The Commissars and
Committees of the Northern Front sent a series of telegrams
refuting the &ldquo;provocative attacks of the Stavka&rdquo; and assuring
that &ldquo;there was no shame in this reverse&rdquo;; that &ldquo;the troops
honestly obey all demands of their leaders ... there have
been no cases of flight or treachery on the part of the troops.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Commissar for the Front, Stankevitch, while demurring
against there being no shame in such a causeless and inglorious
retreat, pointed out, amongst other things, a series of errors and
delinquencies on the part of the Commanders. It is extremely
possible that there were errors, both personal and of leadership,
as well as purely objective deficiencies, caused by mutual mistrust,
slackening of obedience, and the <i>dÃ©bÃ¢cle</i> of the technical
services. At the same time, it is undoubtedly a fact that the
troops of the Northern Front, and especially the 12th Army, were
the most disorganised of all, and, logically, could not offer the
necessary resistance. Even the apologist of the 12th Army,
Commissar Voitinsky, who always considerably exaggerated the
fighting value of these troops, telegraphed on the 22nd to the
Petrograd Soviet: &ldquo;The troops show want of confidence in
their powers, absence of training for battle, and, consequently,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
insufficient steadiness in open warfare.... Many units fight
bravely, as in the early days; others show signs of weariness and
panic.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Actually, the debauched Northern Front had lost all power of
resistance. The troops rolled back to the limit of pursuit by the
German advanced detachments, and only moved forward subsequently
on losing touch with Hutier&rsquo;s main body, which had no
intention of passing, beyond a definite line.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, all the papers of the Left commenced a fierce
campaign against the Stavka and the Commands. The word
&ldquo;treachery&rdquo; was heard.... Tchernov&rsquo;s <i>Delo Naroda</i>, a
Defeatist paper, complained: &ldquo;A torturing fear creeps into the
mind: are not the mistakes of the commanders, the deficiencies
in artillery, and the incapacity of the leaders being unloaded on
to the soldiers&mdash;courageous, heroic, perishing in thousands.&rdquo;
The <i>Izvestia</i> announced also the motives for the &ldquo;provocation&rdquo;:
&ldquo;The Stavka, by putting forth the bogy of menacing events, is
trying to terrorise the Provisional Government and make it adopt
a series of measures, directly and indirectly aimed at the Revolutionary
Democracy and their organisations....&rdquo;</p>

<p>In conjunction with all these events, the feeling against the
Supreme Commander-in-Chief, General Kornilov, was increasing
in the Soviets, and rumours of his approaching dismissal
appeared in the Press. In answer to these, a series of angry
resolutions addressed to the Government, and supporting
Kornilov, made their appearance.<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> The resolution of the Council
of the Union of Cossack Troops contained even the following
passage: &ldquo;The supersession of Kornilov will inevitably imbue
the Cossacks with the fatal impression of the futility of further
Cossack sacrifices&rdquo;; and, further, that the Council &ldquo;declines all
responsibility for the Cossack troops at and behind the Front
should Kornilov be removed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Such was, then, the situation. Instead of pacification, passions
burned fiercer, contradictions increased, the atmosphere of mutual
mistrust and morbid suspicion was thickened.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I still postponed my tour of the troops, not abandoning hope
of a satisfactory issue to the struggle and of the publication of
the &ldquo;Kornilov programme.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span></p>

<p>What could I bring the men? A deep, painful feeling, words
appealing to &ldquo;common-sense and conscience,&rdquo; concealing my
helplessness, and like the voice of one crying in the wilderness?
All had been and gone, leaving bitter memories behind. It will
always be so: thoughts, ideas, words, moral persuasion will
never cease to rouse men to deeds of merit; but what if overgrown,
virgin soil must be torn up with an iron plough?...
What should I say to the officers, sorrowfully and patiently
awaiting the end of the regular and merciless lingering
death of the Army? For I could only say to them: If the
Government does not radically alter its policy the end of the Army
has come.</p>

<p>On the 7th August orders were received to move the Caucasian
Native (&ldquo;Wild&rdquo;) Division from under my command northwards;
on the 12th the same order was received for the 3rd Cavalry
Corps, then in Reserve, and later for the Kornilov &ldquo;shock&rdquo;
Regiment. As always, their destination was not indicated. The
direction prescribed, on the other hand, equally pointed to the
Northern Front, at that time greatly threatened, and to ...
Petrograd. I recommended General Krymov, commanding the
3rd Cavalry Corps, for the command of the 11th Army. The
Stavka agreed, but demanded his immediate departure for
Moghilev on a special mission. On his way there Krymov
reported to me. Apparently he had not yet received definite
instructions&mdash;at any rate, he spoke of none; however, neither he
nor I doubted that the mission was in connection with the
expected change in military policy. Krymov was at this time
cheerful and confident, and had faith in the future; as formerly,
he considered that only a crushing blow to the Soviets could save
the situation.</p>

<p>Following on this, official information was received of the formation
of the Detached Petrograd Army, and the appointment of
an officer of the General Staff to be Quartermaster-General of this
Army was desired.</p>

<p>Finally, about the 20th, the situation became somewhat clearer.
An officer reported to me at Berdichev, and handed me a personal
letter from Kornilov, wherein the latter suggested I should hear
this officer&rsquo;s verbal report. He stated as follows:</p>

<p>&ldquo;According to reliable information, a rising of the Bolsheviks
will take place at the end of August. By this time the 3rd
Cavalry Corps,<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> commanded by Krymov, would reach Petrograd,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
would crush the rising, and simultaneously put an end to the
Soviets.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>Simultaneously, Petrograd would be proclaimed in a state of
war, and the laws resulting from the &ldquo;Kornilov programme&rdquo;
would be published. The Supreme Commander-in-Chief requested
me to despatch to the Stavka a score or more of reliable officers&mdash;officially
&ldquo;for trench mortar instruction&rdquo;; actually they would be
sent to Petrograd, and incorporated in the Officers&rsquo; Detachment.</p>

<p>In the course of the conversation he communicated the news
from the Stavka, painting all in glowing colours. He told me,
among other things, of rumours concerning new appointments to
the Kiev, Odessa and Moscow commands, and of the proposed new
Government, mentioning some existing ministers, and some names
entirely unknown to me. The part played in this matter by the
Provisional Government, in particular by Kerensky, was not clear.
Had he decided on an abrupt change of military policy, would he
resign, or would he be swept away by developments impossible of
prediction by pure logic, or the most prophetic common sense?</p>

<p><i>In this volume I described the entire course of events during
August in that sequence and in that light, in which these tragic days
were experienced on the South-Western Front, not giving them the
perspective of the stage and the actors acquired subsequently.</i></p>

<p>The seconding of the officers&mdash;with all precautions to prevent
either them or their superiors being placed in a false position&mdash;was
commenced, but it is hardly likely that it could have been accomplished
by the 27th. Not one Army Commander was supplied by
me with the information I had received; in fact, not one of the
senior officers at the front knew anything of the events brewing.</p>

<p>It was clear that the history of the Russian Revolution had
entered on a new phase. What would the future bring? General
Markov and I spent many hours discussing this subject. He&mdash;nervous,
hot-headed and impetuous&mdash;constantly wavered between
the extremes of hope and fear. I also felt much the same; and
both of us quite clearly saw and felt the <i>fatal inevitability</i> of a crisis.
The Soviets&mdash;Bolshevists or semi-Bolshevists, no matter which&mdash;would
unfailingly bring Russia to her doom. A conflict was
unavoidable. But <i>over there</i>, was there an actual chance, or was
everything being done in heroic desperation?</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXII" id="CHAPTER_XXXII">CHAPTER XXXII.</a><br />
<span class="smcap">General Kornilov&rsquo;s Movement and its Repercussion on the
South-West Front.</span></h2>

<p>On August 27th I was thunderstruck by receiving from
the Stavka news of the dismissal of General Kornilov from
the post of Supreme Commander-in-Chief.</p>

<p>A telegram, unnumbered, and signed &ldquo;Kerensky,&rdquo; requested
General Kornilov to transfer the Supreme Command temporarily
to General Lukomsky, and, without awaiting the latter&rsquo;s arrival
to proceed to Petrograd. Such an order was quite illegal, and not
binding, as the Supreme Commander-in-Chief was in no way under
the orders either of the War Minister or of the Minister-President,
certainly not of Comrade Kerensky.</p>

<p>General Lukomsky, Chief-of-Staff, answered the Minister-President
in Telegram No. 640, which I give below. Its contents
were transmitted to us, the Commanders-in-Chief by Telegram
No. 6412. which I have not preserved. Its tenor, however, is
clear from the deposition of Kornilov, in which he says: &ldquo;I
ordered that my decision (not to surrender my command, and first
to elucidate the situation), and that of General Lukomsky, be communicated
to the Commanders-in-Chief on all fronts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lukomsky&rsquo;s telegram, No. 640, ran as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>All persons in touch with military affairs were perfectly aware that, in view
of the existing state of affairs, when the actual direction of internal policy was
in the hands of irresponsible public organisations, having an enormously deleterious
effect on the Army, it would be impossible to resurrect the latter; on
the contrary, the Army, properly speaking, would cease to exist in two or three
months. Russia would then be obliged to conclude a shameful separate peace,
whose consequences to the country would be terrible. The Government took
half measures, which, changing nothing, merely prolonged the agony, and, in
saving the Revolution, did not save Russia. At the same time, the preservation
of the benefits of the Revolution depended solely on the salvation of Russia,
for which purpose the first step must be the establishment of a really strong
Government and the reform of the home Front. General Kornilov drew up a
series of demands, the execution of which has been delayed. In these circumstances,
General Kornilov, actuated by no motives of personal gain or aggran<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>disement,
and supported by the clearly-expressed will of the entire right-thinking
sections of the Army and the Civil community, who demanded the speedy establishment
of a strong Government for the saving of their native land, and of the
benefits of the Revolution, considered more severe measures requisite which
would secure the re-establishment of order in the country.</p>

<p>The arrival of Savinkov and Lvov, who in your name made General Kornilov
similar proposals,<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> only brought General Kornilov to a speedy decision. In
accordance with your suggestions, he issued his final orders, which it is now
too late to repeal.</p>

<p>Your telegram of to-day shows that you have now altered your previous
decision, communicated in your name by Savinkov and Lvov. Conscience
demands from me, desiring only the good of the Motherland, to declare to you
absolutely that it is now impossible to stop what was commenced with your
approval; this will lead but to civil war, the final dissolution of the Army, and
a shameful separate peace, as a consequence of which the conquests of the
Revolution will certainly not be secured to us.</p>

<p>In the interests of the salvation of Russia you must work with General
Kornilov, and not dismiss him. The dismissal of General Kornilov will bring
upon Russia as yet unheard-of horrors. Personally, I decline to accept any
responsibility for the Army, even though it be for a short period, and do not
consider it possible to take over the command from General Kornilov, as this
would occasion an outburst in the Army which would cause Russia to perish.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Lukomsky.</span>
</p></blockquote>

<p>All the hopes which had been entertained of the salvation of the
country and the regeneration of the Army by peaceful means had
now failed. I had no illusions as to the consequences of such a
conflict between General Kornilov and Kerensky, and had no
hopes of a favourable termination if only General Krymov&rsquo;s
Corps did not manage to save the situation. At the same time,
not for one moment did I consider it possible to identify myself
with the Provisional Government, which I considered criminally
incapable, and therefore immediately despatched the following
telegram:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I am a soldier and am not accustomed to play hide and seek. On the 16th of
July, in a conference with members of the Provisional Government, I stated
that, by a series of military reforms, they had destroyed and debauched the
Army, and had trampled our battle honours in the mud. My retention as Commander-in-Chief
I explained as being a confession by the Provisional Government
of their deadly sins before the Motherland, and of their wish to remedy
the evil they had wrought. To-day I receive information that General Kornilov,
who had put forward certain demands capable yet of saving the country and
the Army,<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> has been removed from the Supreme Command. Seeing herein a
return to the planned destruction of the Army, having as its consequence the
downfall of our country, I feel it my duty to inform the Provisional Government
that I cannot follow their lead in this.</p>

<p class="right">145 <span class="smcap">Denikin</span>.
</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span></p>

<p>Simultaneously Markov sent a telegram to the Government
stating his concurrence in the views expressed by me.<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>At the same time I ordered the Stavka to be asked in what way
I could assist General Kornilov. He knew that, besides moral
support, I had no actual resources at my disposal, and, therefore,
thanking me for this support, demanded no more.</p>

<p>I ordered copies of my telegrams to be sent to all Commanders-in-Chief,
the Army Commanders of the South-Western Front, and
the Inspector-General of Lines of Communication. I also ordered
the adoption of measures which would isolate the Front against
the penetration of any news of events, without the knowledge of
the Staff, until the conflict had been decided. I received similar
instructions from the Stavka. I think it hardly necessary to state
that the entire Staff warmly supported Kornilov, and all impatiently
awaited news from Moghilev, still hoping for a favourable
termination.</p>

<p>Absolutely no measures for the detention of any persons were
taken: this would have been of no use, and did not enter into
our plans.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Revolutionary Democracy at the Front were
in great agitation. The members of the Front Committee on this
night left their quarters and lodged in private houses on the outskirts
of the town. The assistants of the Commissar were at the
time away on duty, and Iordansky himself in Zhitomir. An invitation
from Markov to him to come to Berdichev had no result,
either that night or on the 28th. Iordansky expected a &ldquo;treacherous
ambush.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Night fell, a long, sleepless night, full of anxious waiting and
oppressive thoughts. Never had the future of the country seemed
so dark, never had our powerlessness been so galling and oppres<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>sive.
A historic tragedy, played out far from us, lay like a
thundercloud over Russia. And we waited, waited.</p>

<p>I shall never forget that night. Those hours still live in
mental pictures. Successive telegrams by direct wire: Agreement
apparently possible. No hopes of a peaceful issue. Supreme
Command offered to Klembovsky. Klembovsky likely to refuse.
One after another copies of telegrams to the Provisional Government
from all Army Commanders of my Front, from General
Oelssner and several other Senior Officers, voicing their adherence
to the opinion expressed in my telegram. A touching fulfilment
of their <i>civic duty</i> in an atmosphere saturated with hate and
suspicion. Their <i>soldier&rsquo;s oath</i> they could no longer keep.
Finally, the voice of despair from the Stavka. For that is the
only name for the General Orders issued by Kornilov on the night
of the 28th:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The telegram of the Minister-President, No. 4163<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> in its entire first part
is a downright lie: it was not I who sent Vv. N. Lvov, a member of the State
Duma, to the Provisional Government. He came to me as a messenger from
the Minister-President. My witness to this is Alexei Aladyin, member of the
State Duma.</p>

<p>The great provocation, placing the Motherland on the turn of fate, is thus
accomplished.</p>

<p>People of Russia. Our great Motherland is dying. Her end is near.</p>

<p>Forced to speak openly, I, General Kornilov, declare that the Provisional
Government, under pressure from the Bolshevik majority in the Soviets, is
acting in complete accordance with the plans of the German General Staff and
simultaneously with the landing of enemy troops near Riga, is killing the
Army, and convulsing the country internally.</p>

<p>The solemn certainty of the doom of our country drives me in these terrible
times to call upon all Russians to save their dying native land. All in whose
breasts a Russian heart still beats, all who believe in God, go into the Churches,
pray Our Lord for the greatest miracle, the salvation of our dear country.</p>

<p>I, General Kornilov, son of a peasant Cossack, announce to all and everyone
that I personally desire nothing save the preservation of our great Russia,
and vow to lead the people, through victory over our enemies, to a Constituent
Assembly, when they themselves will settle their fate and select the form of
our new national life.</p>

<p>I cannot betray Russia into the hands of her ancient enemy&mdash;the German
race!&mdash;and make the Russian people German slaves. And I prefer to die
honourably on the field of battle, that I may not see the shame and degradation
of our Russian land.</p>

<p>People of Russia, in your hands lies the life of your native land!</p></blockquote>

<p>This order was despatched to the Army Commanders for their
information. The next day one telegram from Kerensky was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
received at the Commissariat, and from then all our communications
with the outside world were interrupted.<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>Well, the die was cast. A gulf had opened between the
Government and the Stavka, to bridge which was now impossible.</p>

<p>On the following day, the 28th, the Revolutionary institutions,
seeing that absolutely nothing threatened them, exhibited a
feverish activity. Iordansky assumed the &ldquo;military authority,&rdquo;
made a series of unnecessary arrests in Zhitomir among the
senior officials of the Chief Board of Supplies, and issued, under
his signature and in his own name, that of the Revolutionary
organisations and that of the Commissary of the Province, an
appeal, telling, in much detail and in the usual language of proclamations,
how General Denikin was planning &ldquo;to restore the
old rÃ©gime and deprive the Russian people of Land and
Freedom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the same time similar energetic work was being carried on
in Berdichev under the guidance of the Frontal Committee.
Meetings of all the organisations went on incessantly, along with
the &ldquo;education&rdquo; of the typical rear units of the garrison. Here
the accusation brought forward by the Committee was different:
&ldquo;The counter-Revolutionary attempt of the Commander-in-Chief,
General Denikin, to overthrow the Provisional Government
and restore Nicholas II. to the throne.&rdquo; Proclamations to
this effect were circulated in numbers among the units, pasted on
walls, and scattered from motor-cars careering through the
town. The nervous tension increased, the streets were full of
noise. The members of the Committee became more and more
peremptory and exigent in their relations with Markov. Information
was received of disorders which had arisen on the Lyssaya
Gora (Bald Hill). The Staff sent officers thither to clear up the
matter and determine the possibility of pacification. One of
them&mdash;a Tchekh officer, Lieutenant Kletsando&mdash;who was to have
spoken with the Austrian prisoners, was attacked by Russian
soldiers, one of whom he wounded slightly. This circumstance
increased the disturbance still more.</p>

<p>From my window I watched the crowds of soldiers gathering
on the Lyssaya Gora, then forming in column, holding a prolonged
meeting, which lasted about two hours, and apparently
coming to no conclusion. Finally the column, which consisted of
a troop of orderlies (formerly field military police), a reserve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
<i>sotnia</i>, and sundry other armed units, marched on the town with
a number of red flags and headed by two armoured cars. On
the appearance of an armoured car, which threatened to open
fire, the Orenburg Cossack <i>sotnia</i>, which was on guard next the
Staff quarters and the house of the Commander-in-Chief, scattered
and galloped away. We found ourselves completely in the power
of the Revolutionary Democracy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Revolutionary sentries&rdquo; were posted round the house. The
Vice-President of the Committee, Koltchinsky, led four armed
&ldquo;comrades&rdquo; into the house for the purpose of arresting General
Markov, but then began to hesitate, and confined himself to
leaving in the reception-room of the Chief-of-Staff two &ldquo;experts&rdquo;
from the Frontal Committee to control his work. The following
wireless was sent to the Government: &ldquo;General Denikin and all
his staff have been subjected to personal detention at his Stavka.
In the interests of the defence the guidance of the activity of the
troops has been left in their hands, but is strictly controlled by
the delegates of the Committee.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now began a series of long, endless, wearisome hours. They
will never be forgotten. Nor can words express the depth of the
pain which now enveloped our hearts.</p>

<p>At 4 p.m. on the 29th Markov asked me into the reception-room,
where Assistant-Commissary Kostitsin came with ten to
fifteen armed Committee members and read me an &ldquo;order from the
Commissary of the South-Western Front, Iordansky,&rdquo; according
to which I, Markov, and Quartermaster-General Orlov were to be
subjected to preliminary arrest for an attempt at an armed rising
against the Provisional Government. As a man of letters
Iordansky seemed to have become ashamed of the arguments
about &ldquo;land,&rdquo; &ldquo;freedom,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Nicholas II.,&rdquo; designed
exclusively for inflaming the passions of the mob.</p>

<p>I replied that a Commander-in-Chief could be removed from
his post only by the Supreme Commander-in-Chief or by the
Provisional Government; that Commissary Iordansky was acting
altogether illegally, but that I was obliged to submit to force.</p>

<p>Motor-cars drove up, accompanied by armoured cars, and
Markov and I took our seats. Then came the long waiting for
Orlov, who was handing over the files; then the tormenting
curiosity of the passers-by. Then we drove on to Lyssaya Gora.
The car wandered about for a long time, halting at one building
after another, until at last we drove up to the guard-house; we
passed through a crowd of about a hundred men who were
awaiting our arrival, and were greeted with looks full of hatred
and with coarse abuse. We were taken into separate cells;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
Kostitsin very civilly offered to send me any of my things I might
require, but I brusquely declined any services from him; the door
was slammed to, the key turned noisily in the lock, and I was
alone.</p>

<p>In a few days the Stavka was liquidated. Kornilov, Lukomsky,
Romanovsky, and others were taken off to the Bykhov Prison.</p>

<p>The Revolutionary Democracy was celebrating its victory.</p>

<p>Yet at that very time the Government was opening wide the
doors of the prisons in Petrograd and liberating many influential
Bolsheviks&mdash;to enable them to continue, publicly and openly,
their work of destroying the Russian Empire.</p>

<p>On September 1 the Provisional Government arrested General
Kornilov; on September 4 the Provisional Government liberated
Bronstein Trotsky. These two dates should be memorable for
Russia.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Cell No. 1. The floor is some seven feet square. The window
is closed with an iron grating. The door has a small peep-hole in
it. The cell is furnished with a sleeping bench, a table, and a
stool. The air is close&mdash;an evil-smelling place lies next door.
On the other side is cell No. 2, with Markov in it; he walks up
and down with large, nervous strides. Somehow or other I still
remember that he makes three steps along his cell, while I
manage, on a curve, to make five. The prison is full of vague
sounds. The strained ear begins to distinguish them, and gradually
to make out the course of prison life, and even its moods.
The guards&mdash;I guess them to be soldiers of the prison guard
company&mdash;are rough and revengeful men.</p>

<p>It is early morning. Someone&rsquo;s voice is booming. Whence?
Outside of the window, clinging to the grating, hang two soldiers.
They look at me with cruel, savage eyes, and hysterically utter
terrible curses. They throw in something abominable through
the open window. There is no escape from their gaze. I turn
to the door&mdash;there another pair of eyes, full of hatred, peers
through the peep-hole; thence choice abuse pours in also. I lie
down on the sleeping-bench and cover my head with my cloak.
I lie for hours. The whole day, one after another, the &ldquo;public
accusers&rdquo; replace each other at the window and at the door&mdash;the
guards allow all to come freely. And into the narrow, close
kennel pours, in an unceasing torrent, a foul stream of words,
shouts, and curses, born of immense ignorance, blind hate, and
bottomless coarseness. One&rsquo;s whole soul seems to be drenched
with that abuse, and there is no deliverance, no escape from this
moral torture chamber.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span></p>

<p>What is it all about? &ldquo;Wanted to open the Front&rdquo; ...
&ldquo;sold himself to the Germans&rdquo;&mdash;the sum, too, was mentioned&mdash;&ldquo;for
twenty thousand roubles&rdquo; ... &ldquo;wanted to deprive us
of land and freedom.&rdquo; This was not their own, this was borrowed
from the Committee. But Commander-in-Chief, General, gentleman&mdash;this,
indeed, was their own! &ldquo;You have drunk our blood,
ordered us about, kept us stewing in prison; now we are free and
you can sit behind the bars yourself. You pampered yourself,
drove about in motor-cars; now you can try what lying on a
wooden bench is, you &mdash;&mdash;. You have not much time left. We
shan&rsquo;t wait till you run away&mdash;we will strangle you with our own
hands.&rdquo; These warriors of the rear scarcely knew me at all.
But all that had been gathering for years, for centuries, in their
exasperated hearts against the power they did not love, against
the inequality of classes, because of personal grievances and of
their shattered lives&mdash;for which someone or other was to blame&mdash;all
this now came to the surface in the form of unmitigated
cruelty. And the higher the standing of him who was reckoned
the enemy of the people, and the deeper his fall, the more violent
was the hostility of the mob and the greater the satisfaction of
seeing him in its hands. Meanwhile, behind the wings of the
popular stage stood the managers, who inflamed both the wrath
and the delight of the populace; who did not believe in the
villainy of the actors, but permitted them even to perish for the
sake of greater realism in the performance and to the greater
glory of their sectarian dogmatism. These motives of party
policy, however, were called &ldquo;tactical considerations.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I lay, covered head and all by my cloak and, under a shower of
oaths, tried to see things clearly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What have I done to deserve this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I went through the stages of my life.... My father was
a stern soldier with a most kindly heart. Up to thirty years of
age he had been a peasant serf and was drafted into the Army,
where, after twenty-two years of hard service in the ranks, under
the severe discipline of the times of Nicholas I, he was promoted
to the rank of 2nd Lieutenant. He retired with the rank of Major.
My childhood was hard and joyless, amidst the poverty of a pension
of 45 roubles a month. Then my father died. Life became still
harder. My mother&rsquo;s pension was 25 roubles a month. My youth
was passed in study and in working for my daily bread. I became
a volunteer in the Army, messing in barracks with the privates.
Then came my officer&rsquo;s commission, then the Staff College.
The unfairness of my promotion, my complaint to the Emperor
against the all-powerful Minister of War, and my return to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
the 2nd Artillery Brigade. My conflict with a moribund group
of old adherents of serfdom; their accusation of demagogy. The
General Staff. My practice command of a company in the 183rd
Pultussk Regiment. Here I put an end to the system of striking
the soldiers and made an unsuccessful experiment in &ldquo;conscious
discipline.&rdquo; Yes, Mr. Kerensky, I did this also in my younger
days. I privately abolished disciplinary punishment&mdash;&ldquo;watch one
another, restrain the weak-spirited&mdash;after all, you are decent men&mdash;show
that you can do your duty without the stick.&rdquo; I finished
my command: during the year the behaviour of the company had
not been above the average, it drilled poorly and lazily. After my
departure the old Sergeant-Major, Stsepoura, gathered the company
together, raised his fist significantly in the air and said
distinctly, separating his words:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now it is not Captain Denikin whom you will have. Do you
understand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Sergeant-Major.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was said, afterwards, that the company soon showed
improvement.</p>

<p>Then came the war in Manchuria; active service; hopes for the
regeneration of the Army. Then an open struggle, in a stifled
Press, with the higher command of the Army, against stagnation,
ignorance, privileges and licence&mdash;a struggle for the welfare of the
officer and the soldier. The times were stern&mdash;all my service, all
my military career was at stake. Then came my command of a
regiment, constant care for the improvement of the condition of
the soldiers, after my Pultussk experience&mdash;strict service demands,
but also respect for the human dignity of the soldier. At that time
we seemed to understand one another and were not strangers.
Then came war again, the &ldquo;Iron&rdquo; Division, nearer relations with
the rifleman and work with him in common. The staff was always
near the positions, so as to share mud, want of space, and dangers
with the men. Then a long, laborious path, full of glorious
battles, in which a common life, common sufferings and common
fame brought us still closer together, and created a mutual faith
and a touching proximity.</p>

<p>No, I have never been an enemy to the soldier.</p>

<p>I threw off my cloak, and, jumping from the wooden bed, went
up to the window, where the figure of a soldier clung to the grating,
belching forth curses.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You lie, soldier! It is not your own words that you are
speaking. If you are not a coward, hiding in the rear, if you have
been in action, you have seen how your officers could die. You
have seen that they....&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span></p>

<p>His hands loosened their grip and the figure disappeared. I
think it was simply because of my stern address, which, despite the
impotence of a prisoner, produced its usual effect.</p>

<p>Fresh faces appeared at the window and at the peep-hole in the
door.</p>

<p>It was not always, however, that we met with insolence alone.
Sometimes, through the assumed rudeness of our gaolers we could
see a feeling of awkwardness, confusion and even commiseration.
But of these feelings they were ashamed. On the first cold night,
when we had none of our things, a guard brought Markov, who
had forgotten his overcoat, a soldier&rsquo;s overcoat, but half an hour
later&mdash;whether he had grown ashamed of his good action, or
whether his comrades had shamed him&mdash;he took it back. In
Markov&rsquo;s cursory notes we find: &ldquo;We are looked after by two
Austrian prisoners.... Besides them, we have as our caterer
a soldier, formerly of the Finland Rifles (a Russian), a very
kind and thoughtful man. During our first days he, too, had a
hard time of it&mdash;his comrades gave him no peace; now, however,
matters are all right; they have quieted down. His care for our
food is simply touching, while the news he brings is delightful in
its simplicity. Yesterday, he told me that he would miss us
when we are taken away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I soothed him by saying that our places would soon be filled
by new generals&mdash;that all had not yet been destroyed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>My heart is heavy. My feelings seem to be split in two: I hate
and despise the savage, cruel, senseless mob, but still I feel the old
pity for the soldier: an ignorant, illiterate man, who has been led
astray, and is capable both of abominable crimes and of lofty
sacrifices!</p>

<p>Soon the duty of guarding us was given to the cadets of the
2nd Zhitomir School of 2nd Lieutenants. Our condition became
much easier from the moral point of view. They not only watched
over the prisoners, but also guarded them from the mob. And the
mob, more than once, on various occasions, gathered near the
guard-room and roared wildly, threatening to lynch us. In such
cases the company on guard gathered hastily in a house nearly
opposite us and the cadets on guard made ready their machine-guns.
I recall that, calmly and clearly realising my danger, when
the mob was especially stormy, I planned out my method of self-defence:
a heavy water-bottle stood upon my table; with it I might
hit the first man to break into my cell; his blood would infuriate
and intoxicate the &ldquo;comrades,&rdquo; and they would kill me at once,
without torturing me....</p>

<p>With the exception, however, of such unpleasant moments, our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
life in prison went on in a measured, methodical way; it was quiet
and restful; after the strain of our campaigning, and in comparison
with the moral suffering we had undergone, the physical inconveniences
of the prison rÃ©gime were mere trifles. Our life was
varied by little incidents. Sometimes a Bolshevist cadet standing
at the door would tell the sentry loudly, so that his words might
be heard in the cell, that at their last meeting the comrades of
Lyssaya Gora, having lost all patience, had finally decided to lynch
us, and added that this was what we deserved. Another time,
Markov, passing along the corridor, saw a cadet sentry leaning on
his rifle, with the tears streaming from his eyes&mdash;he felt sorry for
us. What a strange, unusual exhibition of sentiment in our savage
days.</p>

<p>For a fortnight I did not leave my cell for exercise, not wishing
to be an object of curiosity for the &ldquo;comrades,&rdquo; who surrounded
the square before the guard-room and examined the arrested
generals as if they were beasts in a menagerie. I had no communication
with my neighbours, but much time for meditation and
thought.</p>

<p>And every day as I open my window I hear from the house
opposite a high, tenor voice&mdash;whether of friend or foe I know not&mdash;singing:</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is the last day that I ramble with you, my friends.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXXIII">CHAPTER XXXIII.</a></h2>

<p class="chapsummary"><span class="smcap">In Berdichev Gaol&mdash;The Transfer of the &ldquo;Berdichev Group&rdquo;
of Prisoners to Bykhov.</span></p>

<p>Besides Markov and me, whose share in events has been
depicted in the preceding chapters, the following were cast
into prison:</p>

<p>3. General Erdeli, Commander of the Special Army.</p>

<p>4. Lieutenant-General Varnovsky, Commander of the 1st
Army.</p>

<p>5. Lieutenant-General Selivatchev, Commander of the 7th
Army.</p>

<p>6. Lieutenant-General Eisner, Chief of Supplies to the South-Western
Front.</p>

<p>The guilt of these men lay in their expression of solidarity with
my telegram No. 145, and of the last, moreover, in his fulfilment
of my orders for the isolation of the frontal region with respect
to Kiev and Zhitomir.</p>

<p>7 and 8. General Eisner&rsquo;s assistants&mdash;General Parsky and
General Sergievsky&mdash;men who had absolutely no connection with
events.</p>

<p>9. Major-General Orlov, Quartermaster-General of the Staff
of the Front&mdash;a wounded man with a withered arm, timid, and
merely carrying out the orders of the Chief-of-Staff.</p>

<p>10. Lieutenant Kletsando, of the Tchekh troops, who had
wounded a soldier of Lyssaya Gora on August 28th.</p>

<p>11. Captain Prince Krapotkin, a man over sixty years of age,
a Volunteer, and the Commandant of the Commander-in-Chief&rsquo;s
train. He was not initiated into events at all.</p>

<p>General Selivatchev, General Parsky and General Sergievsky
were soon released. Prince Krapotkin was informed on September
6th that his actions had not been criminal, but was set free
only on September 23rd, when it appeared that we were not to be
tried at Berdichev. For a charge of rebellion to hold good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
against us an association of eight men at the very least had to be
discovered. Our antagonists were much interested in this figure,
being desirous of observing the rules of decorum.... There
was another prisoner, however, kept in reserve and separate from
us, at the Commandant&rsquo;s office, and even afterwards transferred
to Bykhov&mdash;a military official named Boudilovitch&mdash;a youth weak
in body, but strong in spirit, who on one occasion dared to tell
a wrathful mob that it was not worth the little finger of those
whom it was maltreating.<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> No other crime was imputed to him.</p>

<p>On the second or third day of my imprisonment I read in a
newspaper, which had accidentally or purposely found its way into
my cell, an order from the Provisional Government to the Senate,
dated August 29th, which ran as follows:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lieutenant-General Denikin, Commander-in-Chief of the
Armies of the South-Western Front, to be removed from the post
of Commander-in-Chief and brought to trial for rebellion.&mdash;Signed:
Minister-President A. Kerensky and B. Savinkov&mdash;in
charge of the War Ministry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the same date similar orders were issued concerning
Generals Kornilov, Lukomsky, Markov and Kisliakov. Later
an order was issued for the removal of General Romanovsky.</p>

<p>On the second or the third day of my arrest the guard-room
was visited, for our examination, by a Committee of Investigation,
under the superintendence of the Chief Field Prosecutor of
the Front, General Batog, and under the presidency of Assistant-Commissar
Kostitsin, consisting of:</p>

<p>Lieutenant-Colonel Shestoperov, in charge of the Juridical
Section of the Commissariat; Lieutenant-Colonel Frank, of the
Kiev Military Court; 2nd Lieut. Oudaltsov and Junior Sergeant of
Artillery Levenberg, members of the Committee of the Front.</p>

<p>My evidence, in view of the facts of the case, was very short,
and consisted of the following statements: (1) None of the persons
arrested with me had taken part in any active proceedings
against the Government; (2) all orders given to and through the
Staff during my last days, in connection with General Kornilov&rsquo;s
venture, proceeded from me; (3) I considered, and still consider,
that the activity of the Provisional Government is criminal and
ruinous for Russia, but that nevertheless I had not instituted a
rebellion against it, but having sent my telegram No. 145, I had
left it to the Provisional Government to take such action towards
me as it might see fit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span></p>

<p>Later the Chief Military Prosecutor, Shablovsky, having
acquainted himself with the material of the investigation and
with the circumstances which had arisen around it in Berdichev,
was horrified at the &ldquo;uncautious formulation&rdquo; of my evidence.</p>

<p>By September 1st Iordansky was already reporting to the War
Ministry that the Committee of Investigation had discovered
documents establishing the existence of a conspiracy which had
long been preparing.... At the same time, Iordansky, man
of letters, inquired of the Government whether, in the matter of
the direction of the cases of the Generals arrested, he could act
within the limits of the law, <i>in conformity with local circumstances</i>,
or whether he was bound to be guided by any <i>political considerations</i>
of the Central Authority. In reply he was informed that he
must act reckoning with the law alone and ... <i>taking into
consideration local circumstances</i>.<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p>In view of this explanation, Iordansky decided to commit us
for trial by a Revolutionary Court-Martial, to which end a Court
was formed of members of one of the Divisions formerly subordinated
to me at the Front, while Captain Pavlov, member of the
Executive Committee of the South-Western Front, was marked
down for public prosecutor.</p>

<p>Thus the interests of competency, impartiality and fair play
were observed.</p>

<p>Iordansky was so anxious to obtain a speedy verdict for myself
and for the Generals imprisoned with me that on September 3rd he
proposed that the Commission, without waiting for the elucidation
of the circumstances, should present the cases to the Revolutionary
Court-Martial in groups, as the guilt of one or other of
the accused was established.</p>

<p>We were much depressed by our complete ignorance of what
was taking place in the outer world.</p>

<p>On rare occasions Kostitsin acquainted us with the more important
current events, but in the Commissar&rsquo;s comments on
the events only depressed us still more. It was clear, however,
that the Government was breaking up altogether, that Bolshevism
was raising its head higher and higher, and that the country must
inevitably perish.</p>

<p>About September 8th or 10th, when the investigation was over,
our prison surroundings underwent, to some extent, a change.
Newspapers began to appear in our cells almost daily; at first
secretly, afterwards, from September 22nd, officially. At the same
time, after the relief of one of the Companies of Guards, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
decided to try an experiment: during our exercise in the corridor
I approached Markov and started talking with him; the sentries
did not interfere. From that time we began talking with one
another every day; sometimes the sentries demanded that we
should stop, and then we were silent at once, but more frequently
they did not interfere. In the second half of September visitors
also were allowed; the curiosity of the &ldquo;comrades&rdquo; of Lyssaya
Gora was now apparently satisfied; fewer of them gathered about
the square, and I used to go out to walk every day, was able to
see all the prisoners and exchange a few words with them now
and again. Now, at least, we knew what was doing in the world,
while the possibility of meeting one another removed the depression
caused by isolation.</p>

<p>From the papers we learned that the investigation of the
Kornilov case was committed to the Supreme Investigation Committee,
presided over by the Chief Military and Naval Prosecutor,
Shablovsky.<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>About September 9th, in the evening, a great noise and the
furious shouts of a large crowd were heard near the prison. In
a little while four strangers entered my cell&mdash;confused and much
agitated by something or other. They said they were the President
and members of the Supreme Committee of Investigation for
the Kornilov case.<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>Shablovsky, in a still somewhat broken voice, began to explain
that the purpose of their arrival was to take us off to Bykhov, and
that, judging by the temper which had developed in Berdichev,
and by the fury of the mob which now surrounded the prison, they
could see that there were no guarantees for justice here, but only
savage revenge. He added that the Committee had no doubt as
to the inadmissibility of any segregation of our cases, and as to
the necessity of a common trial for all the participators in the
Kornilov venture, but that the Commissariat and the Committees
were using all means against this. The Committee, therefore,
asked me whether I would not wish to supplement my evidence by
any facts which might yet more clearly establish the connection
between our case and Kornilov&rsquo;s. In view of the impossibility of
holding the examination amidst the roar of the crowd which had
gathered, they decided to postpone it to the following day.</p>

<p>The Committee departed; soon after the crowd dispersed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span></p>

<p>What more could I tell them? Only, perhaps, something of
the advice which Kornilov had given me at Moghilev, and
through a messenger. But this was done as a matter of exceptional
confidence on the part of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief,
which I could in no case permit myself to break. Therefore, the
few details which I added next day to my original evidence did not
console the commission and did not, apparently, satisfy the volunteer,
a member of the Committee of the Front, who was present at
the examination.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, we waited with impatience for our liberation from
the Berdichev chamber of torture. But our hopes were clouded
more and more. The newspaper of the Committee of the Front
methodically fomented the passions of the garrison; it was reported
that at all the meetings of all the Committees resolutions were
passed against letting us out of Berdichev; the Committee members
were agitating mightily among the rear units of the garrison,
and meetings were held which passed off in a spirit of great
exaltation.</p>

<p>The aim of the Shablovsky Commission was not attained. As
it turned out in the beginning of September, to Shablovsky&rsquo;s
demand that a separate trial of the &ldquo;Berdichev group&rdquo; should
not be allowed, Iordansky replied that &ldquo;to say nothing of the
transfer of the generals to any place whatsoever, even the least
postponement of their trial would threaten Russia with incalculable
calamities&mdash;complications at the front, and a new civil war in the
rear,&rdquo; and that both on political and on tactical grounds it was
necessary to have us tried in Berdichev, in the shortest possible
time, and by Revolutionary Court-Martial.<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p>The Committee of the Front and the Kiev Soviet of Workmen&rsquo;s
and Soldiers&rsquo; Delegates would not agree to our transfer, despite
all the arguments and persuasions brought forward at their
meeting by Shablovsky and the members of his Commission. On
the way back, at Moghilev, a consultation took place on this question
between Kerensky, Shablovsky, Iordansky and Batog. All,
excepting Shablovsky, came to the altogether unequivocal conclusion
that the front was shaken, that the soldiery was restless and
demanding a victim, and that it was necessary to enable the tense
atmosphere to discharge itself, even at the cost of injustice....
Shablovsky rose and declared that he would not permit such a
cynical attitude toward law and justice.</p>

<p>I remember that this tale perplexed me. It is not worth while
disputing about points of view. But if the Minister-President is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
convinced that in the matter of protecting the State it is admissible
to let oneself be guided by expediency, in what way, then, was
Kornilov to blame?</p>

<p>On September 14th a debate took place in Petrograd, in the
last &ldquo;court of appeal&rdquo;&mdash;in the military section of the Executive
Committee of the Council of Workmen&rsquo;s and Soldiers&rsquo; Delegates&mdash;between
Shablovsky and the representative of the Committee of
the South-Western Front, fully supported by Iordansky. The
last two declared that if the Revolutionary Court-Martial was not
held on the spot, in Berdichev, in the course of the next five days
the lynching of the prisoners was to be feared. However, the
Central Committee agreed with Shablovsky&rsquo;s arguments, and sent
its resolution to that effect to Berdichev.</p>

<p>So an organised lynching was prevented. But the Revolutionary
institutions of Berdichev had at their service another
method for liquidating the &ldquo;Berdichev group,&rdquo; an easy and
irresponsible one&mdash;the method of popular wrath....</p>

<p>A rumour spread that we were to be taken away on the 23rd,
then it was stated that our departure would take place on the 27th
at 5 p.m. from the passenger station.</p>

<p>To take the prisoners away without making the fact public was
in no way difficult: in a motor-car, on foot in a column of cadets,
or, again, in a railway carriage&mdash;a narrow gauge-line came close
up to the guard-house and joined on to the broad gauge-line outside
the town and the railway station.<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> But such a method of transferring
us did not agree with the intentions of the Commissariat
and the Committees.</p>

<p>General Doukhonin inquired from the Stavka, of the Staff of
the Front, whether there were any reliable units in Berdichev, and
offered to send a detachment to assist in our move. The Staff of
the Front declined assistance. The Commander-in-Chief, General
Volodchenko, had left on the eve, the 26th, for the Front....</p>

<p>Much talk and an unhealthy atmosphere of expectation and
curiosity were being artificially created around this question....</p>

<p>Kerensky sent a telegram to the Commissariat: &ldquo;I am sure of
the prudence of the garrison, which may elect, from among its
numbers, two representatives to accompany.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the morning the Commissariat began visiting all the units
in the garrison, to obtain their consent to our transfer.</p>

<p>The Committee had appointed a meeting of the whole garrison
for 2 p.m., <i>i.e.</i>, three hours before our departure, and in the field,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
moreover, immediately beside our prison. This mass meeting did
indeed take place; at it the representatives of the Commissariat
and of the Committee of the Front announced the orders for our
transfer to Bykhov, thoughtfully announced the hour of our departure
and appealed to the garrison ... to be prudent; the
meeting continued for a long time and, of course, did not disperse.
By 5 o&rsquo;clock an excited crowd of thousands of men had surrounded
the guard-room, and its dull murmur made its way into the
building.</p>

<p>Among the officers of the Cadet Battalion of the 2nd Zhitomir
School of 2nd Lieutenants, which was on guard this day, was
Captain Betling, wounded in many battles, who before the War had
served in the 17th Archangelogorod Infantry Regiment, which I
commanded.<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> Betling asked the superior officer of the School to
replace by his half-company the detachment appointed to accompany
the prisoners to the railway station. We all dressed and
came out into the corridor. We waited. An hour, two hours
passed....</p>

<p>The meeting continued. Numerous speakers called for an
immediate lynching.... The soldier who had been wounded
by Lieutenant Kletsando was shouting hysterically and demanding
his head.... Standing in the porch of the guard-room,
Assistant Commissaries Kostitsin and Grigoriev were trying
persuasion with the mob. That dear Betling, too, spoke
several times, hotly and passionately. We could not hear his
words.</p>

<p>At last, pale and agitated, Betling and Kostitsin came up to me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How will you decide? The crowd has promised not to
touch anyone, only it demands that you should be taken to the
station on foot. But we cannot answer for anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I replied:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I took off my cap and crossed myself:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lord, bless us!&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The crowd raged. We, the seven of us, surrounded by a
group of cadets, headed by Betling, who marched by my side with
drawn sword, entered the narrow passage through this living
human sea, which pressed on us from all sides. In front were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
Kostitsin and the delegates (twelve to fifteen) chosen by the garrison
to escort us. Night was coming on, and in its eerie gloom, with
the rays of the searchlight on the armoured car cutting through it
now and then, moved the raving mob, growing and rolling on
like a flaming avalanche. The air was full of a deafening roar,
hysterical shouts, and mephitic curses. At times they were covered
by Betling&rsquo;s loud, anxious voice:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Comrades, you have given your word!... Comrades,
you have given your word!...&rdquo;</p>

<p>The cadets, those splendid youths, crushed together on all sides,
push aside with their bodies the pressing crowd, which disorders
their thin ranks. Passing the pools left by yesterday&rsquo;s rain, the
soldiers fill their hands with mud and pelt us with it. Our faces,
eyes, ears, are covered with its fetid, viscid slime. Stones come
flying at us. Poor, crippled General Orlov has his face severely
bruised; Erdeli and I, as well, were struck&mdash;in the back and on
the head.</p>

<p>On our way we exchanged monosyllabic remarks. I turned to
Markov:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What, my dear Professor, is this the end?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Apparently....&rdquo;</p>

<p>The mob would not let us come up to the station by the straight
path. We were taken by a roundabout way, some three miles
altogether, through the main streets of the town. The crowd is
growing. The balconies of the Berdichev houses are full of
curious spectators; the women wave their handkerchiefs. Gay,
guttural voices come from above:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Long live freedom!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The railway station is flooded with light. There we find a new,
vast crowd of several thousand people. And all this has merged
in the general sea which rages and roars. With enormous difficulty
we are brought through it under a hail of curses and of glances full
of hatred. The railway carriage. An officer&mdash;Elsner&rsquo;s son&mdash;sobbing
hysterically and addressing impotent threats to the mob,
and his soldier servant, lovingly soothing him, as he takes away
his revolver; two women, dumb with horror&mdash;Kletsando&rsquo;s wife and
sister, who had thought to see him off....</p>

<p>We wait for an hour, for another. The train is not allowed
to leave&mdash;a prisoner&rsquo;s car is demanded. There were none at the
station. The mob threatens to do for the Commissaries. Kostitsin
is slightly buffeted. A goods car is brought, all defiled with horse-dung&mdash;what
a trifle! We enter it without the assistance of a platform;
poor Orlov is lifted in with difficulty; hundreds of hands are
stretched towards us through the firm and steady ranks of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
cadets.... It is already 10 p.m. The engine gives a jerk.
The crowd booms out still louder. Two shots are heard. The train
starts.</p>

<p>The noise dies away, the lights grow dimmer. Farewell
Berdichev!</p>

<p>Kerensky shed a tear of delight over the self-abnegation of
&ldquo;our saviours&rdquo;&mdash;as he called&mdash;not the cadets, but the Commissaries
and the Committee members.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What irony of fate! General Denikin, arrested as Kornilov&rsquo;s
accomplice, was saved from the rage of the frenzied soldiers by the
members of the Executive Committee of the South-Western Front
and by the Commissaries of the Provisional Government.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I remember with what agitation I and the never-to-be-forgotten
Doukhonin read the account of how a handful of these
brave men escorted the arrested generals through a crowd of
thousands of soldiers who were thirsting for their blood....&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>
Why slander the dead? Certainly, Doukhonin was no less anxious
for the fate of the prisoners than for ... the fate of their
revolutionary escort....</p>

<p>That Roman citizen, Pontius Pilate, smiled mockingly through
the gloom of the ages....</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXXIV">CHAPTER XXXIV.</a><br />
<span class="smcap">Some Conclusions as to the First Period of the Revolution.</span></h2>

<p>History will not soon give us a picture of the Revolution in
a broad, impartial light. Those prospects which are now
opening out to our view are sufficient only to enable us to grasp
certain particular phenomena in it and, perhaps, to reject the
prejudices and misconceptions which have sprung up around them.</p>

<p>The Revolution was inevitable. It is called a Revolution of the
whole people. This is correct only in so far as the Revolution
was the Result of the discontent of literally all classes of the
population with the old power. But upon the question of its
achievements opinions were divided, and deep breaches were
bound to appear between classes on the very next day after the
downfall of the old Power.</p>

<p>The Revolution was many-faced. For the peasants&mdash;the ownership
of the land; for the workmen&mdash;the ownership of profits; for
the Liberal Bourgeoisie&mdash;changed political conditions of life in the
land and moderate social reforms; for the Revolutionary Democracy&mdash;power
and the maximum of social achievement; for the
Army&mdash;absence of authority and the cessation of the War.</p>

<p>With the downfall of the power of the Czar, there was left in
the country, until the summoning of a Constituent Assembly, no
lawful power, no power that had a juridical basis. This is perfectly
natural and follows from the very nature of a Revolution. But
whether through genuine misconception or deliberately perverting
the truth, men have fabricated theories, known to be false, about
the &ldquo;general popular origin of the Provisional Government&rdquo; or
about the &ldquo;full powers of the Soviet of Workmen&rsquo;s and Soldiers&rsquo;
Delegates,&rdquo; as an organ supposed to represent the &ldquo;whole of the
Russian Democracy.&rdquo; What an elastic conscience one must have,
if, while professing democratic principles and protesting violently
against the slightest deviation from orthodox conditions of the
lawfulness of elections, one can still ascribe full powers, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
the organ of democracy, to the Petrograd Soviet or to the
Congress of Soviets, the election of which is of an extraordinary
simplified and one-sided character. It was not without reason
that for a long time the Petrograd Soviet hesitated to publish
lists of its members. As to the supreme Power, to say nothing
of its &ldquo;popular origin&rdquo; from a &ldquo;private meeting of the State
Duma,&rdquo; the technique of its construction was so imperfect
that repeated crises might have put an end to its very existence
and to every trace of its continuity. Finally, a really &ldquo;popular&rdquo;
Government could not have remained isolated, left by all to the
will of a group of usurpers of authority. That same Government
which, in the days of March, so easily obtained general recognition.
Recognition, yes, but not practical support.</p>

<p>After March 3rd, and up to the Constituent Assembly, <i>every</i>
supreme authority bore the marks of self-assumed power, and <i>no</i>
power could satisfy all classes of the population, in view of the
irreconciliableness of their interests and the intemperance of their
desires.</p>

<p>Neither of the ruling powers (the Provisional Government and
the Soviet) enjoyed the due support of the <i>majority</i>. For this
majority (80 per cent.) said, through its representatives in the
Constituent Assembly of 1918: &ldquo;We peasants make no difference
between parties; parties fight for power, while our peasant business
is the land alone.&rdquo; But even if, forestalling the will of the Constituent
Assembly, the Provisional Government had satisfied these
desires of the majority in full, it could not have reckoned on this
majority&rsquo;s immediate submission to the general interests of the
State, nor on its <i>active</i> support: engaged in the redistribution of
the land, which also had a strong attraction for the elements at
the Front, the peasantry would scarcely have given the State,
voluntarily, the forces and the means for putting it in order,
<i>i.e.</i> plenty of corn and plenty of soldiers&mdash;brave, faithful and
obedient to the law. Even then the Government would have been
faced with insoluble problems: an Army which did not fight,
an unproductive industry, a transport system which was being
broken down and ... the civil war of parties.</p>

<p>Let us, therefore, set aside the popular and democratic origin
of the Provisional authority. Let it be self-assumed, as it has been
in the history of all revolutions and of all peoples. But the very
fact of the wide recognition of the Provisional Government gave it
a vast advantage over all the other forces which disputed its
authority. It was necessary, however, that this power should
become so strong, so absolute in its nature, so autocratic, as,
having crushed all opposition by force, perhaps by arms, to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
led the country to a Constituent Assembly, elected in surroundings
which did not admit of the falsification of the popular vote, and to
have protected this Assembly.</p>

<p>We are apt to abuse the words &ldquo;elemental force,&rdquo; as an
excuse for many phenomena of the Revolution. That &ldquo;molten
element&rdquo; which swept Kerensky away with the greatest ease, has
it not fallen into the iron grip of Lenin-Bronstein and, for more
than three years, been unable to escape from Bolshevist duress?</p>

<p>If such a power, harsh, but inspired by reason and by a true
desire for popular rule, had assumed authority and, having crushed
the <i>licence</i> into which <i>freedom</i> had been transmuted, had led this
authority to a Constituent Assembly, the Russian people would
have blessed, not condemned it. In such a position will every
provisional authority find itself which accepts the heritage of
Bolshevism; and Russia will judge it, not by the juridical marks
of its origin, but by its works.</p>

<p>Why is the overthrow of the incompetent authority of the old
Government to be an achievement, to the memory of which the
Provisional Government proposed erecting a monument in the
Capital, while the attempt to overthrow the incompetent authority
of Kerensky, made by Kornilov, after exhausting all lawful means
and after provocation on the part of the Minister-President, is to
be counted rebellion?</p>

<p>But the need for a powerful authority is far from being
exhausted by the period preceding the Constituent Assembly. Did
not the Assembly of 1918 call in vain on the country, not for
submission, but simply for protection from physical outrage on the
part of the turbulent sailor horde? Yet not a hand was raised
in its defence. Let us grant that <i>that</i> Assembly, born in an
atmosphere of mutiny and violence, did not express the will of the
Russian people and that the future Assembly will reflect that will
more perfectly. I think, however, that even those who have the
most exalted faith in the infallibility of the democratic principle
do not close their eyes to the unbounded possibilities of the future
which will be the heritage of such a physical and psychological
transformation in the people as is unknown to history and has
never yet been investigated by anyone.</p>

<p>Who knows whether it may not be necessary to confirm the
democratic principle, the authority itself of the Constituent
Assembly, and its commands, by iron and fresh bloodshed....</p>

<p>Be that as it may, the <i>outward</i> recognition of the Provisional
Government took place. It would be difficult and useless to
separate, in the work of the Government, that which proceeded
from its free will and sincere convictions from what bears the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
stamp of the forcible influence of the Soviet. If Tzeretelli was
entitled to declare that &ldquo;there has never yet been a case when, in
important questions, the Provisional Government has not been
ready to come to an agreement,&rdquo; so have we the right to identify
their work and their responsibility.</p>

<p>All this activity, <i>volens nolens</i>, bore the character of destruction,
not creation. The Government repealed, abolished,
disbanded, permitted.... In this lay the centre of gravity of
its work. I picture to myself the Russia of that period as a very
old house, in need of capital reconstruction. In the absence of
means and while waiting for the building season (the Constituent
Assembly), the builders began extracting the decayed girders,
some of which they did not replace at all, others they replaced
with light, temporary props, and others again they reinforced with
new baulks without fastenings&mdash;the latter means turning out to be
the worst. And the house crashed down. The causes of such a
method of building were first: the absence of a complete and
symmetrical plan among the Russian political parties, the whole
energy, mental and will tension of which were directed mainly
towards the destruction of the former order. For we cannot give
the name of practical plans to the abstract outlines of the party
programmes; they are rather lawful or unlawful diplomas for the
right of building. Secondly&mdash;that the new ruling classes did not
possess the most elementary technical knowledge of the art of
ruling, as the result of a systematic, age-long setting them
aside from these functions. Thirdly&mdash;the non-forestalling of the
will of the Constituent Assembly, which, in any case, called for
heroic measures for its summoning, and therewith no less heroic
measures for securing real freedom of election. Fourthly&mdash;the
odiousness of all that bore the stamp of the old order, even though
it were sound at bottom. Fifthly&mdash;the self-conceit of the political
parties, each of which individually represented the &ldquo;will of the
whole people&rdquo; and was distinguished by extreme irreconciliableness
towards its antagonists.</p>

<p>I might probably continue this list for a long time, but I shall
pause on one fact which has a significance which is far from being
confined to the past. The Revolution was expected, it was
prepared, but <i>no one</i>, not a single one of the political groups <i>had
prepared itself for it</i>. And the Revolution came by night, finding
everyone, like the foolish virgins in the Gospel, with lamps unlit.
One cannot explain and excuse everything by elemental forces
alone. No one had troubled to construct beforehand a general
plan of the canals and sluices necessary to prevent the inundation
from becoming a flood. Not one of the leading parties possessed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
a programme for the interregnum in the life of the country, a
programme which, in its character and scale, could not correspond
with normal plans of construction, either in the system of administration
or in the sphere of economic and social relations. It would
scarcely be an exaggeration to say that the only assets in the
possession of the progressive and Socialist blocks on March 27th,
1917, were: for the former&mdash;the choice for the post of Minister-President
of Prince Lvov, for the latter&mdash;the Soviets and Order
No. 1. After this began the convulsive, unsystematic vacillation
of the Government and of the Soviet.</p>

<p>It is to be regretted that this difference, which constitutes a
marked distinction between two periods&mdash;the provisional and
the constructive&mdash;two systems, two programmes, has not yet
become sufficiently clear in public consciousness.</p>

<p>The whole period of the active struggle with Bolshevism passed
under the sign of the mingling of these two systems, of divergent
views and of incapacity to construct a provisional form of authority.
It would seem that now, too, the anti-Bolshevist forces, while
increasing the divergence of their views and building plans for
the future, are not preparing for the process of assuming the power
after the downfall of Bolshevism, and will again approach the task
with naked hands and wavering mind. Only now the process will
be immeasurably more difficult. For the second excuse&mdash;after
&ldquo;elemental forces&rdquo;&mdash;for the failure of the Revolution, or rather
of its leading men&mdash;&ldquo;the heritage of the Czarist rÃ©gime&rdquo;&mdash;has
paled very much on the background of the sanguinary Bolshevist
mist which has enveloped the land of Russia.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The new power (the Provisional Government) was faced by a
question of the first importance&mdash;the War. On its decision rested
the fate of the country. The decision in favour of continuing
the alliance and the War rested on ethical motives, which at that
time did not rouse any doubts, and on practical motives, which
were in some degree disputable. Now, even the former have
been shaken, since both the Allies and the enemy have treated the
fate of Russia with cruel, cynical egotism. Nevertheless, I have
no doubt of the correctness of the decision then taken to continue
the War. Many suppositions might be made as to the possibilities
of a separate peace&mdash;whether that of Brest-Litovsk or one less
grievous for the State and for our national self-love. But it is to
be thought that such a peace in the spring of 1917 would have led
either to the dismemberment of Russia and her economic <i>dÃ©bÃ¢cle</i>
(a general peace at the expense of Russia), or to the complete<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
victory of the Central Powers over our Allies, which would have
produced incomparably deeper convulsions in their countries than
those which the German people are now experiencing. Both in
the one case and in the other, no objective data would be present
for any change for the better in the political, social and economic
conditions of Russian life and any turning of the Russian Revolution
into other channels. Only, besides Bolshevism, Russia would
have added to her liabilities the hatred of the defeated for many
years.</p>

<p>Having decided to fight, it was necessary to preserve the Army
by admitting a certain conservatism into it. Such a conservatism
serves as a guarantee for the stability of the Army and of that
authority which seeks support in it. If the participation of the
Army in historical cataclysms cannot be avoided, neither can it
be turned into an arena for political struggle, creating, instead of
the principle of service&mdash;<i>pretorians or opritchniks</i>, whether of the
Czar, of the Revolutionary Democracy, or of any party is a
matter of indifference.</p>

<p>The Army was broken up.</p>

<p>On those principles which the Revolutionary Democracy took
as a basis for the existence of the Army, the latter could neither
build nor live. It was no mere chance that all the later attempts
at armed conflict with Bolshevism began with the organisation of
an Army on the normal principles of military administration, to
which the Soviet command as well sought to pass gradually. No
elemental circumstances, no errors on the part of military dictatorships
and of the powers co-operating with or opposing them which
led to the failure of the struggle (of this some truths will be spoken
later) are able to cast this undeniable fact into the shade. Nor is
it a mere chance that the leading circles of the Revolutionary
Democracy could create no armed forces, except that pitiful parody
on them&mdash;the &ldquo;National Army&rdquo; on the so-called &ldquo;front of the
Constituent Assembly.&rdquo; It was just this circumstance that led
the Russian Socialist emigrants to the theory of non-resistance,
of the negation of armed struggle, to the concentration of all
their hopes on the inner degeneration of Bolshevism and its overthrow
by some immaterial &ldquo;forces of the people themselves,&rdquo;
which, however, could not express themselves otherwise than by
blood and iron: &ldquo;the great, bloodless&rdquo; Revolution is drowned in
blood from its beginning to its end.</p>

<p>To refuse to consider that vast question&mdash;the re-creation of a
National Army on firm principles&mdash;is not to solve it.</p>

<p>What then? On the day that Bolshevism falls will peace and
good-will immediately show forth in a land corrupted by a slavery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
worse than that of the Tartar yoke, saturated with dissension,
revenge, hatred, and ... an enormous quantity of arms? Or,
from that day forward, will the self-interested desires of many
foreign Governments disappear, or will they grow stronger when
the menace of the moral infection of the Soviet has vanished?
Finally, even should the whole of old Europe, morally regenerated,
beat out its swords into ploughshares, is it impossible for
a new Tchingiz-Khan to come out of the depths of that Asia which
has accounts age-long and huge beyond measure, against Europe?</p>

<p>The Army will be regenerated. Of that there can be no doubt.</p>

<p>Shaken in its historical foundations and traditions, like the
heroes of the Russian legends, it will stand for no short time
at the cross-roads, gazing anxiously into the misty distances, still
wrapped in the gloom before the dawn, and listening intently to
the vague sounds of the voices calling to it. And among the
delusive calls it will seek, straining its hearing to the utmost, for
the real voice ... the voice of its own people.</p>

Consider change in Supreme Command extremely dangerous when the threat
of an external enemy to the integrity of our native land and our freedom
demands the speedy adoption of measures for the strengthening of the discipline
and fighting value of our Army.&rdquo; &ldquo;Western Front&mdash;General Baluev: The
present situation of Russia demands the immediate adoption of exceptional
measures, and the retention of General Kornilov at the head of the Army is
an imperative necessity, no matter what the political situation.&rdquo; &ldquo;Roumanian
Front&mdash;General Scherbachev: The dismissal of General Kornilov will infallibly
have a fatal effect on the Army and the defence of the Motherland. I appeal
to your patriotism in the name of the salvation of our native land.&rdquo; All the
Commanders-in-Chief mentioned the necessity for the introduction of the
measures demanded by Kornilov.</p></div>
